	<h2>"ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND" <span>Lewis Carroll</span></h2>

	<h3><span>Chapter 1.</span> Down the Rabbit Hole</h3>
	<div>
	
<p>
	Alice was tired of sitting near her
sister on the bank of the river. She
had nothing to do: once or twice she
looked into the book that her sister was
reading. But the book had no pictures
or conversations in it. “What is the use
of a book,” thought Alice “without
pictures or conversations?”</p><p>
	She was thinking about making
a daisy-chain, but the day was hot
and she felt very sleepy and lazy.
Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink
eyes ran past her.</p><p>
	The Rabbit said to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear, I shall be late!”
Then it took a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it,
and hurried on. Alice stood up and
burning with curiosity ran across
the field after it. So she was just in
time to see that the Rabbit jumped down
 a large rabbit hole under the
hedge.</p><p>
	Alice went down after it. The rabbit
hole was like a tunnel, and then it
suddenly went down. It was so sudden
that Alice didn’t have time to think.
And the next moment she was falling
down the well. The well was so deep
or she was falling so slowly that she
had time to look around. She saw cupboards
and bookshelves; there were
maps and pictures there, too. But she
was falling down and down. “I must
be near the centre of the earth,” Alice
said aloud. “I wonder if I shall fall
right through the earth How funny
it will be to see people that walk with
their heads down!</p><p>
Down, down, down. “Dinah will
miss me very much, I think!” (Dinah
was the cat.) Dinah, my dear!” And
Alice felt sleepy when suddenly,
thump! And the fall was over — she
was on a heap of dry leaves.</p><p>
Alice jumped up on to her feet and
looked up, but it was all dark there. The
White Rabbit was still hurrying along
a corridor. Alice went after him like a
wind and heard the Rabbit say “Oh
my ears and whiskers, how late it is!”
and it turned the corner. She turned the
corner too but couldn’t see the Rabbit.
She was now in a long hall.</p><p>
	There were doors all around the
hall, but they were all locked. Suddenly,
Alice saw a little glass table
with a tiny golden key on it. But
the locks in all the doors were very
large, and the key was very small,
and it couldn’t open them. But then
suddenly Alice noticed a low curtain
with a little door behind it. To her
great delight the golden key opened
it!</p><p>
Behind the door was a small corridor
which lead to a very beautiful
garden. Alice wanted so much to
be among those bright flowers and
cool fountains! But even her head
couldn’t get through the little door.</p><p>
So she went back to the table hoping
to find another key on it. But
this time she found there a little
bottle with a paper label with large
letters on it: “DRINK ME”.</p><p>
Alice didn’t want to do that in
a hurry. Maybe it was poison. But
the bottle did NOT say “poison”, so
Alice tasted it, and it was very nice,
so soon she drank it all.</p><p>
	“What a curious feeling!” said
Alice, “I must be shutting up like a
telescope”. And now she was only 
ten inches high. And she could go
through that little door! But poor Alice!
When she was near the door, she
remembered that the little golden key
was on the table. She went back and
saw that she couldn’t take it from the
glass table because she was too small.
So she sat down and cried.</p><p>
“But there is no use in crying”
said Alice to herself, and soon she
noticed a little glass box under the
table. She opened it and found in it a
very small cake with the words “EAT
ME” in currants. She ate a little bit
but nothing happened, so very soon
she ate all the cake.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 2.</span> The Pool of Tears</h3>
<div>

<p>
	“Curiouser and curiouser!”, cried
Alice (she was so surprised that for
the moment she forgot how to speak
good English). “Now I’m opening out
like the largest telescope! Good-bye,
feet!” (she looked down at her feet,
and they were almost out of sight).
“Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who
will put on your shoes and stockings
for you now, dears? I will be too far
away. But I will send you a new pair 
of boots every Christmas. How funny
it will seem!”</p><p>
“Oh dear, what nonsense I’m
talking!”</p><p>
At that moment her head hit the
roof of the hall: now she was more
than nine feet high. So she took the
little golden key again and hurried to
the garden door.</p><p>
Poor Alice! This time she could
look into the garden with only one
eye. So she sat down and began to
cry again.</p><p>
“You must be ashamed of yourself,”
said Alice, “Stop this moment,
I tell you!” But she continued crying,
and soon there was a large pool all
around her.</p><p>
Suddenly, she heard some sound
in the distance and quickly dried
her eyes to see what it was. It was
the White Rabbit returning. It was
beautifully dressed and had a pair of
white gloves in one hand and a large
fan in the other. It was in a great
hurry saying, “Oh! The Duchess, the
Duchess!” Alice needed help so much
that when the Rabbit came near her,
she began in a low voice, “Please,
sir...” The Rabbit jumped up in horror,
dropped the white gloves and the
fan and ran away into the darkness as
fast as it could.</p><p>
	Alice took the Rabbit’s gloves
and the fan and began thinking how
strange everything was that day.
“And yesterday things were just as
usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed
during the night. Who am I? That’s
the great puzzle!” And while she was
thinking about that mystery, she
suddenly noticed that she had put
on one of the Rabbit’s white gloves.</p><p>
“How could I do that?” she thought.</p><p>
“Maybe I am growing small again.”</p><p>
So she went to the table to check it
and found that she was now about
two feet high and she was continuing
to get smaller and smaller. And then
she understood that it was the fan in
her hand and she quickly dropped it.
“And now to the garden!” and
Alice ran fast to the little door
but, alas! The little door was locked
again, and the golden key was still
on the glass table. “And I am so
small now!”</p><p>
As she said these words, her foot
slipped and in another moment,
splash! She was in salt water. Her
first idea was about the sea. However,
she soon understood that she was in
the pool of her own tears.</p><p>
“I am so sorry I cried so much! I
will be drowned in my own tears!
That WILL be strange! However, everything
is strange today!”</p><p>
	Just then she heard something
splashing about in the pool and
swam nearer to see what it was. At
first, she thought it was a walrus or a
hippo, but then she remembered how
small she was now and understood
that it was only a mouse.</p><p>
“Shall I speak to this mouse?”
thought Alice. “I believe it can
talk. I think I will try.” So she
began, “O Mouse, do you know the
way out of this pool? I am very
tired of swimming here!” But the
mouse said nothing.</p><p>
“Perhaps it doesn’t understand
English,” thought Alice; “Maybe it’s
a French mouse.” So she began again
this time with the first sentence in
her French lesson-book, “Ou` est ma
chatte?” The Mouse jumped up out
of the water in horror. “Oh, I beg
your pardon!” cried Alice, “I forgot
you didn’t like cats.”</p><p>
“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse.
“Would YOU like cats if you were
me?” </p><p>
	“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice,
“don’t be angry about it. But I would
like you to see our cat Dinah. I think
you would start liking cats if you could see her. She is such a nice
quiet thing.”</p><p>
“No! Our family always HATED
cats: nasty things! I don’t want to
hear this name again!” the Mouse was
trembling down to the end of its tail.
“I am sorry!” said Alice in a great
hurry to change the subject of conversation.
“Are you ... are you fond
... of ... of dogs?” The Mouse didn’t
answer, so Alice continued speaking
about dogs. But the Mouse was swimming
away from her.</p><p>
“Mouse dear! Come back again,
and we won’t talk about cats or dogs
if you don’t like them!” Alice called
softly. When the Mouse heard this, it
turned round and swam slowly back
to her. “Let us get to the shore, and
I’ll tell you my story, and you’ll understand
why I hate cats and dogs,”</p><p>
it said. It was high time to go because
more and more animals were swimming
in the pool: there was a Duck
and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet
and several other creatures. Alice
swam to the shore and everybody
swam after her.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 3.</span> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</h3>
<div>

<p>
	The group looked very strange:
the birds and the animals were all
wet, angry and unhappy. The first
question of course was how to get dry
again; they discussed it, and at last
the Mouse said, “Sit down, all of you,
and listen to me! I’ll soon make you
dry enough!” They all sat down at
once, in a large ring with the Mouse
in the middle.</p><p>
“Are you all ready?” asked the
mouse with an important look, “This
is the driest thing I know. Silence,
please!” and the Mouse began speaking
about the history of England.
After some time it asked turning to
Alice, “How are you now, my dear?”</p><p>
“As wet as ever,” answered Alice
sadly.</p><p>
“In that case,” said the Dodo,
rising to its feet, “the best thing
to get dry would be a Caucus-race.”</p><p>
“And the best way to explain it is to
do it.” It added.</p><p>
	First, it marked out a race-course
in a circle, and then all the party
stood along the course. And they
began running when they liked and
stopped when they liked, so it was
not easy to know when the race was over.</p><p>
 However, after half an hour of
running the Dodo suddenly cried,
“The race is over!” and they all
crowded around it asking, “But who
has won?”</p><p>
	The Dodo couldn’t answer this
question at once, so it sat for a long
time thinking while the rest waited
in silence. At last, the Dodo said,
“EVERYBODY has won, and all must
have prizes.”</p><p>
“But who will give us the prizes?”
the voices asked.</p><p>
“Well, SHE, of course,” said the
Dodo, pointing at Alice with one finger,
and everybody at once crowded
around her crying, “Prizes! Prizes!”
Alice had no idea what to do, and in
despair she put her hand into her pocket
and took out a box of comfits (luckily
the salt water had not got into it) and
gave them to everybody as prizes.</p><p>
“But she must have a prize herself,”
said the Mouse.</p><p>
“Of course,” the Dodo answered
seriously. “What else have you got
in your pocket?” he asked turning
to Alice.</p><p>
“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.</p><p>
“Give it to me,” it said.</p><p>
Then they all crowded round her
again while the Dodo solemnly presented
the thimble saying, “We beg
you to accept this elegant thimble,”
and when it finished this short
speech, they all cheered.</p><p>
	Alice thought the whole thing
very absurd, but they all looked
so serious that she couldn’t laugh,
and she bowed and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she could.
After they had eaten the comfits,
they sat down again in a ring and
asked the Mouse to tell them something
more.</p><p>
“You promised to tell me your story,”
said Alice, “and why you hate —
C and D,” she added in a whisper.</p><p>
“My tale is long and sad!” said the
Mouse sighing.</p><p>
“It IS a long tail of course!” said
Alice looking down at the Mouse’s
tail with wonder. “But why do you
call it sad?” And she continued
thinking about it while the Mouse
was speaking.</p><p>
“You are not listening!” cried the
Mouse to Alice angrily. “What are
you thinking of?”</p><p>
“I beg your pardon,” said Alice
very politely, “you had come to the
fifth point, I think?”</p><p>
“I had NOT!” cried the Mouse very
angrily.</p><p>
“A knot!” said Alice looking
around. “Oh, let me help you to undo
it!”</p><p>
The Mouse stood up and said walking
away, “You insult me by talking
such nonsense!”</p><p>
	“I didn’t want to do it!” cried poor
Alice. “But you’re so easily offended!”
The Mouse didn’t answer.</p><p>
“Please come back and finish your
story!” Alice called after it, and all
the others repeated, “Yes, please
do!” but the Mouse only shook its
head, and soon it was out of sight.</p><p>
“What a pity our Dinah is not
here!” Alice said aloud. “She would
soon bring it here!”</p><p>
“And who is Dinah?” asked the
Lory.</p><p>
Alice was always ready to talk
about her pet, “Dinah”s our cat. And
she’s so good at catching mice! And
oh, the same about birds! Well, she’ll
eat a little bird as soon as it looks
at it!”</p><p>
After Alice’s speech all the party
hurried away on different pretexts,
and Alice was soon alone.</p><p>
	“I wish I hadn’t spoken about
Dinah!” she said to herself sadly.
“It seems nobody likes her here, and
I’m sure she’s the best cat in the
world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder
if I shall ever see you again!” And
here poor Alice began to cry again 
because she felt very lonely and
low-spirited. However, a little later
she again heard footsteps in the
distance. She looked up hoping that
the Mouse had changed its mind
and was coming back to finish its
story.<p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 4.</span> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</h3>
<div>

<p>
	It was the White Rabbit coming
slowly back and looking around as if
it had lost something. Alice heard it
saying to itself, “The Duchess! The
Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my
fur and whiskers! I’ll be executed,
I’m sure! Where COULD I drop them,
I wonder?” Alice understood that it
was looking for the fan and the pair
of white kid gloves, and she began
looking for them too, but they were
nowhere to be seen.</p><p>
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice
and asked her in an angry tone,
“Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you
doing here? Run home this moment,
and fetch me a pair of gloves and a
fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so
frightened that she ran immediately
in the direction it pointed to.</p><p>
“He took me for his housemaid,”
she said to herself as she ran. “How 
surprised he’ll be when he finds out
who I am! But I’d better bring him
his fan and gloves — of course, if
I can find them.” As she said this,
she came to a neat little house, on
the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name “W. RABBIT”
engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs.</p><p>
	Soon she was in a tidy little room
with a table in the window, and on it
were a fan and two or three pairs of
tiny gloves. Alice took the fan and
one pair and was going to leave the
room when she saw a little bottle.
This time there was no label on it
with the words “DRINK ME”, but
she still put it to her lips. “I know
SOMETHING interesting will happen,”
she said to herself. “I hope
I’ll grow large again, because I’m
quite tired of being such a tiny little
thing!”</p><p>
It happened so quickly that in the
next moment her head was pressing
against the ceiling. “Now I can’t get
out of the door — Why did I drink
so much?”</p><p>
Alas! It was too late! She continued
growing and growing and very
soon had to kneel down on the floor.
Still she went on growing, and at
last she put one arm out of the window
 and one foot up the chimney and
said to herself, “What WILL become
of me?”</p><p>
	Fortunately, Alice stopped growing,
but she felt very unhappy. “It
was much pleasanter at home,”
thought poor Alice, “when nobody
grew larger and smaller. When I
read fairy-tales, I thought that such
things never happened, and now here
I am in one of them!”</p><p>
“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” she heard
the voice outside. “Fetch me my
gloves this moment!” Alice knew it
was the Rabbit coming to look for
her.</p><p>
When the Rabbit came up to the
door, it tried to open it but couldn’t
because Alice’s elbow was pressed
against it. Alice heard it say to
itself, “Then I’ll go round and get in
at the window.”</p><p>
But when the Rabbit was just
under the window she spread out
her hand and immediately heard a
little shriek and a fall and a crash
of broken glass. Then the Rabbit’s
angry voice cried, “Bill! Bill! Where
are you? Come and help me! And
take that thing away from the window!”</p><p>
	There was a long silence after
this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then, and at last 
she spread out her hand again. This
time there were TWO little shrieks
and more sounds of broken glass.</p><p>
“I wonder what they’ll do next!”
thought Alice.</p><p>
“We must burn the house down!”
said the Rabbit’s voice, and Alice
called out as loud as she could, “If
you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”
There was a dead silence instantly.
After a minute or two, they began
moving about again, and the next
moment a lot of little pebbles came
in through the window, and some
of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put
a stop to this,” she said to herself.
But suddenly she noticed with some
surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes, and a bright
idea came into her head. “If I eat one
of these cakes,” she thought, “it’ll
surely make SOME change in my
size; and as it can’t possibly make
me larger, it must make me smaller,
I suppose.”</p><p>
So she swallowed one of the cakes
and began shrinking. As soon as she
was small enough to get through the
door, she ran out of the house. She
ran off as hard as she could, and soon
she was in a thick wood.</p><p>
	“The first thing I must do,” said
Alice to herself, “is to grow to my
right size again, and the second thing
is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p><p>
 I think that will be the best
plan.”</p><p>
It sounded an excellent plan, no
doubt; the only difficulty was: she
had not the smallest idea how to
start. I suppose I must eat or drink
something, but the great question is,
what?” Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the grass, but she did
not see anything that looked like
the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances. There was a large
mushroom growing near her, about
the same height as herself, so she
looked under it and on both sides of
it and behind it, and then she decided
to see what was on top of it.</p><p>
When she looked over the edge of
the mushroom, her eyes immediately
met the eyes of a large caterpillar
that was sitting on the top, quietly
smoking a long hookah.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 5.</span> Advice from a Caterpillar</h3>
<div>

<p>
	The Caterpillar and Alice looked at
each other for some time in silence: at
last the Caterpillar took the hookah
out of its mouth and said in a sleepy
voice, “Who are YOU?”</p><p>
Alice answered shyly, “I am not
sure now. At least I know who I WAS when
 I got up this morning, but I
have changed several times since
then.</p><p>
“What do you mean by that?” said
the Caterpillar. “Explain yourself!”</p><p>
“I can’t explain MYSELF, I’m
afraid, sir” said Alice, “because I’m
not myself, you see.”</p><p>
“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p>
“I’m afraid I can’t explain it more
clearly,” Alice answered very politely,
“because I can’t understand
it myself.”</p><p>
“You!” said the Caterpillar
thoughtfully. “Who are YOU?”
And they were at the beginning of
the conversation again. Alice drew
herself up and said seriously, “I think
you must tell me who YOU are first.”</p><p>
“Why?” said the Caterpillar.</p><p>
It was another difficult question;
and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, she turned away.</p><p>
“Come back!” the Caterpillar
called her. “I’ve something important
to say!”</p><p>
Alice turned and came back again.</p><p>
“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p>
“Is that all?” said Alice, hiding
her anger as well as she could.</p><p>
“No,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p>
	For some minutes it didn’t say
anything, but at last it took the hookah
out of its mouth and said, “So
you think you’re changed, do you?”</p><p>
“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice.</p><p>
“I don’t keep the same size for ten
minutes!”</p><p>
“What size do you want to be?”
it asked.</p><p>
“Oh, it’s not actually the size,”
Alice answered. “It’s just not very
pleasant to change so often, you
know.”</p><p>
“I DON’T know,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she felt that
she was losing her temper.</p><p>
“Is it fine now?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I would like to be a LITTLE
larger, sir,” said Alice, “three inches
is not the best height.”</p><p>
“It is a very good height!” said the
Caterpillar angrily (it was exactly
three inches high).</p><p>
“But it’s not usual for me!” answered
poor Alice. And she thought
to herself, “The creatures here are so
easily offended!”</p><p>
“You’ll get used to it in time,”
said the Caterpillar, and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began
smoking again.</p><p>
	This time Alice waited patiently
until it spoke again. In a minute or
two the Caterpillar took the hookah
out of its mouth and yawned once or
twice. Then it got down off the mushroom
and crawled away in the grass,
telling Alice, “One side will help you
grow taller, and the other side will
help you grow shorter.”</p><p>
“One side of WHAT? The other
side of WHAT?” thought Alice to
herself.</p><p>
“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar,
just as if she had asked it
aloud, and in another moment it was
out of sight.</p><p>
Alice looked at the mushroom
thoughtfully for a minute, and at last
she put her arms around it as far as
she could and broke off a piece of the
mushroom with each hand. Then she
very carefully started nibbling first
at one piece and then at the other,
and growing sometimes taller and
sometimes shorter, until she was her
usual height again.</p><p>
“Now I’m back to my right size:
the next thing is to get into that
beautiful garden — how can I do
that, I wonder?” As she said this, she
suddenly came to a little house about
four feet high. “It’s not a good idea
to come to those who live here THIS
size — they will be very frightened!”
So she started nibbling at the piece 
of the mushroom in her right hand
again, and soon she was only nine
inches high.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 6.</span> Pig and Pepper</h3>
<div>

<p>
	For a minute or two Alice stood
looking at the house and thinking
what to do next when suddenly a
footman in livery ran out of the wood
(actually it was a fish in livery) and
knocked loudly at the door. The door
was opened by another footman in
livery, with large eyes like a frog’s;
and both footmen, Alice noticed, had
curled powdered hair. She felt very
curious and walked a little out of the
wood to listen.</p><p>
The Fish-Footman took a great
letter from under his arm and gave
it to the other footman, saying, in a
solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An
invitation from the Queen to play
croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated,
in the same solemn tone, “From
the Queen. An invitation for the
Duchess to play croquet.”
Then they both bowed low, and
their curls got entangled together.</p><p>
 Alice laughed so much at this that
she had to run back into the wood
because the creatures could hear her.
When she looked out of the wood
again, she saw only the Frog-footman
sitting on the ground near the door.</p><p>
	Alice went shyly up to the door
and knocked.</p><p>
“There’s no use in knocking,” said
the Footman, “for two reasons. Firstly,
because I’m on the same side of
the door as you are; secondly, because
they’re making such a noise inside no
one could hear you.” And really there
was a great noise in the house.</p><p>
“Please,” said Alice, “how can I
get in?”</p><p>
“I shall sit here,” the Footman
said, “till tomorrow —”
At this moment the door of the
house opened, and a large plate came
flying out and broke to pieces against
one of the trees behind the Footman.
“— or next day, maybe,” the Footman
continued in the same tone.</p><p>
“But what am I to do?” said Alice.</p><p>
“Anything you like,” replied the
Footman and began whistling.</p><p>
“Oh, there’s no use in talking to
him!” said Alice, opened the door
and went in.</p><p>
Behind the door was a large kitchen
full of smoke. The Duchess was sitting
 on a stool in the middle, nursing
a baby; the cook was cooking soup.</p><p>
“There’s too much pepper in that
soup!” Alice remarked to herself
sneezing.</p><p>
	There was too much pepper in the air
too. Even the Duchess sneezed sometimes,
and the baby was sneezing and
crying all the time. The only things in
the kitchen that did not sneeze were the
cook and a large cat which was grinning
widely.</p><p>
“Please could you tell me,” said
Alice, a little modestly, “why your
cat grins like that?”</p><p>
“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the
Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”
Alice saw that the Duchess addressed
the baby and not her so she
decided to continue.</p><p>
“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats
always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
know that cats COULD grin.”</p><p>
“They all can,” remarked the
Duchess, “and most of them do.”</p><p>
“Hey! You may nurse it a bit, if
you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
throwing the baby to her. “I must go
and get ready to play croquet with
the Queen,” and she hurried out of
the room. Alice caught the baby with some
difficulty. And it took her some time
 to start nursing it because it
was wriggling and grunting all the
time. As soon as she could keep it
tight in her hands, she took it out
into the open air.</p><p>
	Alice was just beginning to think
to herself, “Now, what will I do with
this creature when I get it home?”
when it grunted again, so loudly that
she looked down into its face in some
alarm. There could be NO mistake
about it: it was a pig, and she felt
quite absurd to keep it in her hands.
So she put the little creature
down, and it trotted away into the
wood. Suddenly, she saw the Cheshire
cat sitting in a tree. The Cat only
grinned when it saw Alice.</p><p>
“Cheshire Puss,” she began shyly.
The Cat only grinned a little wider.</p><p>
“Could you please tell me which way
to go from here?”</p><p>
“It depends on where you want to
get to,” said the Cat.</p><p>
“It’s not so important for me
where —” said Alice.</p><p>
“Then it doesn’t matter which
way you go,” said the Cat.</p><p>
“— until I get SOMEWHERE,”
Alice added as an explanation.</p><p>
	“Oh, you’ll surely do that,” said
the Cat, “if you walk long enough.”
“And what people live about here?”
asked Alice.</p><p>
“In THAT direction,” the Cat
said, waving its right paw, “lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,”
waving the other paw, “lives a
March Hare. Visit the one that you
like: they’re both mad.”</p><p>
“But I don’t want to go to mad
people,” Alice answered.</p><p>
“Oh,” said the Cat, “but we’re all
mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”</p><p>
“How do you know I’m mad?” inquired
Alice.</p><p>
“You must be,” said the Cat, “or
you wouldn’t be here. Do you play
croquet with the Queen today?”
“I would like it very much,” said
Alice, “but I haven’t been invited
yet.”</p><p>
“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat,
and vanished.</p><p>
Suddenly it appeared again.</p><p>
“By the way, what became of the
baby?” wondered the Cat. “I forgot
to ask.”</p><p>
“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly
said.</p><p>
“I thought so,” said the Cat and
vanished again.</p><p>
	Alice waited a little, but it
did not appear, so she walked in
the direction of the March Hare’s
house. “I’ve seen hatters before,”
she said to herself, “the March
Hare will be much more interesting,
and perhaps as this is May it
won’t be absolutely mad — at least
not as mad as it was in March.” As
she said this, she looked up, and
there was the Cat again, sitting
on a tree.</p><p>
“Did you say pig or fig?” asked
the Cat.</p><p>
“I said pig,” replied Alice, “and
could you please stop appearing and
vanishing so suddenly?”</p><p>
“All right,” answered the Cat,
and this time it vanished slowly, beginning
with the end of the tail and
ending with the grin, which remained
in the tree for some time.</p><p>
“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without
a grin,” thought Alice, “but a
grin without a cat! It’s the most
curious thing I ever saw in my life!”
And she walked to the March
Hare’s house. She saw it quite soon:
the chimneys looked like ears and the
roof was covered with fur.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 7.</span> A Mad Tea-Party</h3>
<div>

<p>
	There was a table under a tree in
front of the house, and the March
Hare and the Hatter were having
tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep.</p><p>
The table was large, but the three
were all together at one corner of it.</p><p>
“No room! No room!” they cried out
when they saw Alice. “There’s a LOT
of room!” said Alice indignantly,
and she sat down in a large armchair
at one end of the table.</p><p>
“Have some wine,” the March
Hare said in an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table,
but there was nothing on it except
tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.</p><p>
“There isn’t any,” said the March
Hare.</p><p>
“Then it wasn’t very polite of you
to offer it,” said Alice angrily.</p><p>
“It wasn’t very polite of you to sit
down without invitation,” said the
March Hare. “I didn’t know it was YOUR table,”
said Alice. “It’s laid for much
more than three.”</p><p>
The party sat silent for a minute.
The Hatter spoke first. “What day
of the month is it?” he said, turning
to Alice: he had taken his watch out
of his pocket and was looking at it,
shaking it, and holding it to his ear.
Alice thought a little and then
said, “The fourth.”</p><p>
“Two days wrong!” noted the
Hatter. “I told you butter couldn’t
help!” he added looking angrily at
the March Hare.</p><p>
“It was the BEST butter,” the
March Hare replied. He took the
watch and looked at it unhappily;
then he put it into his cup of tea and
looked at it again, but he could only
repeat, “It was the BEST butter.”</p><p>
“What a funny watch!” Alice
remarked. “It tells the day of the
month and doesn’t tell the time!”</p><p>
“Why should it?“ inquired the
Hatter. “Does YOUR watch tell you
what year it is?”</p><p>
“Of course not,” Alice replied
readily, “but that’s because it stays
the same year for a long time.”</p><p>
“So does MINE,” said the Hatter.</p><p>
“I don’t quite understand you,”
Alice said, as politely as she could.</p><p>
	“Well, you know, we quarreled
with Time last March — just before
HE went mad —” (pointing at the
March Hare,) “— it was at the great
concert given by the Queen of Hearts
where I had to sing. I hadn’t finished
the first part of the song when the
Queen shouted, ‘He’s murdering the
time! Off with his head!’”</p><p>
“Oh, how cruel!” exclaimed Alice.</p><p>
“And since that,” the Hatter went
on sadly, “it’s always six o’clock
now.”</p><p>
A bright idea came into Alice’s
head. “Is that why so many teathings
are here?” she asked.</p><p>
“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter
with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and
we’ve no time to wash the things.”</p><p>
“Then you move round all the
time, I suppose?” said Alice.</p><p>
“Exactly so,” said the Hatter.</p><p>
“But what happens when you come
to the beginning again?” Alice decided
to ask.</p><p>
“Let’s change the subject,” the
March Hare yawned. “I think the
lady will tell us a story.”</p><p>
“I’m afraid I don’t know any,”
said Alice.</p><p>
“Then take some more tea,” the
March Hare told Alice very seriously.</p><p>
	“I’ve had no tea yet,” Alice replied
in an offended tone, “so I can’t take
more.”</p><p>
“You mean you can’t take LESS,”
said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to
take MORE than nothing.”</p><p>
Alice helped herself to some tea
and bread-and-butter.</p><p>
“I want a clean cup,” suddenly
said the Hatter, “let’s all move one
place on.”</p><p>
He moved on, and the Dormouse
moved on too; the March Hare moved
into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice
unwillingly took the place of the
March Hare. But only the Hatter had
a clean cup. Alice got the plate and
the cup after the March Hare.</p><p>
She didn’t like it at all, so she
stood up and walked away; the Dormouse
fell asleep, and nobody called
her back. When she turned to look at
them, she saw that they were trying
to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p><p>
“I’ll never go THERE again!” said
Alice as she was walking through the
wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party
I ever was at in all my life!”</p><p>
	Just as she said this, she noticed
that one of the trees had a door in it.</p><p>
“That’s very curious!” she thought.</p><p>
“But everything’s curious today. I 
think I will go in at once.” And she
went in.</p><p>
Once more she was in the long hall,
and near the little glass table. “I’ll
do better this time,” she said to
herself and first took the little golden
key and unlocked the door into
the garden. Then she nibbled at the
mushroom a few times (a piece of it
was in her pocket) till she was about
a foot high; then she walked down
the little corridor behind the door:
and THEN — at last she was in the
beautiful garden, among the bright
flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 8.</span> The Queen’s Croquet-Ground</h3>
<div>	
	
	<p>
	A large rose-tree stood near the
entrance of the garden: the roses
were white, but there were three
gardeners painting them red. Alice
thought this was very curious, and
she went nearer to watch them. They
were quarrelling. Suddenly, one of
the gardeners noticed Alice who was
standing and watching them. The
others saw her too, and all of them
bowed low.</p><p>
“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a
little timidly, “why you are painting
those roses?” One of the gardeners whose name
was Two explained, “It must be a
RED rose-tree, but we planted a
white rose-tree by mistake. If the
Queen knows about it, we will all
have our heads cut off. So we are doing
what we can before she comes ...</p><p>
” At this moment the gardener whose
name was Five cried, “The Queen!
The Queen!” and the three gardeners
fell down onto the ground. Alice
heard the sound of many footsteps
and looked round to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers who looked
like the three gardeners, with their
hands and feet at the corners; next
were the ten courtiers ornamented
with diamonds. Then came ten royal
children; they were all ornamented
with hearts. Next came the guests,
mostly Kings and Queens, and among
them Alice recognised the White
Rabbit: it didn’t notice her. Then followed
the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the King’s crown on a cushion, and
last came THE KING AND QUEEN
OF HEARTS.</p><p>
Alice stood still and waited. When
the procession came near her, they all
stopped and looked at her.</p><p>
“What’s your name, child?” the
Queen asked turning to Alice.</p><p>
	“My name is Alice, your Majesty,”
said Alice very politely. And she added
to herself, “They’re only a pack
of cards. It’s stupid to be afraid of
them!”</p><p>
“And who are THESE?” said the
Queen, pointing at the three gardeners
lying round the rose-tree.</p><p>
“How can I know?” said Alice,
surprised at her own courage. “It’s
no business of MINE.”</p><p>
The Queen became red with anger
and screamed “Off with her head!
Off —”</p><p>
“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly
and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.</p><p>
The King put his hand upon her
arm and timidly said, “My dear, she
is only a child!”</p><p>
“Can you play croquet?” the
Queen shouted her question after a
pause.</p><p>
The soldiers were silent and looked
at Alice as the question was for her.</p><p>
“Yes!” Alice shouted back.</p><p>
“Come on, then!” shouted the
Queen, and Alice joined the procession.</p><p>
	“It’s — it’s a very fine day!”
said a timid voice near her. She was
walking near the White Rabbit, who
was looking anxiously into her face.</p><p>
“Very,” said Alice.“ — Where’s
the Duchess?”</p><p>
“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit
in a low tone. He looked anxiously
around and whispered into Alice’s
ear, “She will be executed.”</p><p>
“What for?” said Alice.</p><p>
“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the
Rabbit asked.</p><p>
“No, I didn’t,” said Alice. “I don’t
think it’s a pity. I said ‘What for?’”</p><p>
“She boxed the Queen’s ears —”
the Rabbit began. Alice laughed.</p><p>
“Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in
a frightened tone. “The Queen will
hear you! You see, she came late, and
the Queen said —”</p><p>
“Get to your places!” shouted the
Queen very loudly, and the game
began. Alice had never seen such
a curious croquet-ground in her
life: the balls were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes and the
arches were made of soldiers.</p><p>
The main difficulty for Alice was to
use her flamingo: when she was going
to hit the hedgehog with its head, it
looked up in her face with such a puzzled
 expression that she began laughing;
when she was ready to begin again,
the hedgehog was crawling away. So
Alice soon came to the conclusion that
it was really a very difficult game.</p><p>
	The players all played at once
without waiting for each other,
quarrelling all the time and fighting
for the hedgehogs; very soon the
Queen became furious and shouted
“Off with his head!” or “Off with her
head!” every minute.</p><p>
Alice began thinking how to get
away. Suddenly, she noticed something
curious in the air. Soon she
understood it was a grin of the
Cheshire Cat.</p><p>
“How are you getting on?” said
the Cat as soon as his mouth appeared.
Alice waited till the whole head
appeared, put down her flamingo,
and began to tell the Cat about the
game. The Cat probably thought a
head was enough, so no more of
him appeared.</p><p>
“How do you like the Queen?” said
the Cat in a low voice.</p><p>
“Not at all,” said Alice, “she’s so
—” Just then she noticed that the
Queen was behind her, listening:
so she went on, “— likely to win 
that it’s not interesting to finish
the game.”</p><p>
	The Queen smiled and moved on.
“Who ARE you talking to?” said
the King, coming up to Alice and
looking at the Cat’s head with great
curiosity.</p><p>
“It’s a friend of mine — a
Cheshire Cat,” said Alice, “allow me
to introduce it.”</p><p>
“I don’t like the look of it,” said
the King, “however, it may kiss my
hand if it likes.”</p><p>
“I don’t,” the Cat remarked.</p><p>
“Don’t be rude,” said the King,
“and don’t look at me like that!” He
stood behind Alice as he spoke.</p><p>
“A cat may look at a king,” said
Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
but I don’t remember where.”</p><p>
“Well, it must be removed,” said
the King very decidedly and called
the Queen.</p><p>
The Queen knew only one way.</p><p>
“Off with his head!” she said, without
even looking.</p><p>
“I’ll bring the executioner myself,”
said the King and hurried
away.</p><p>
Alice decided to go back and watch
the game. When she caught her flamingo,
there were no hedgehogs or
arches around. So she went back to
talk with her friend a little more. 
When she got back to the Cheshire
Cat, she was surprised to see a large
crowd around him.</p><p>
Alice could only say “He belongs
to the Duchess: ask HER about him.”
“She’s in prison,” the Queen said
to the executioner, “Bring her here.”
And the executioner went off.</p><p>
At that moment the Cat’s head
began fading away, and when the
executioner was back with the Duchess,
it had disappeared completely.
So the King and the executioner
began looking for it while all the
others went back to the game.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 9.</span> The Mock Turtle’s Story</h3>
<div>

<p>
	“You can’t imagine how glad I am
to see you again, my dear!” said the
Duchess when she and Alice walked
off together.</p><p>
Alice was very glad to see her so
pleasant, and she thought to herself
that perhaps only the pepper had
made her so angry when they met in
the kitchen.</p><p>
“When I’M a Duchess,” she said
to herself, (but not in a very hopeful
tone), “I won’t have any pepper in
my kitchen AT ALL. Soup is good
without it.” She quite forgot about the Duchess
and was a little frightened when
she heard her voice close to her ear.</p><p>
“You’re thinking about something,
my dear, and you forget to talk.”
Alice did not like very much to be
so close to the Duchess: first, because
the Duchess was VERY ugly; and
secondly, because she put her chin
on Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However,
she did not like to be rude, so she
didn’t say anything.</p><p>
“Are you wondering why I don’t
put my arm round your waist?” the
Duchess said after a pause, “The reason
is, I’m afraid of your flamingo.”</p><p>
“HE can bite,” Alice replied.</p><p>
	“Very true,” said the Duchess,
“flamingoes and mustard both bite.
And the moral of that is — ‘Birds of
a feather flock together.’”</p><p>
“But mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice
remarked.</p><p>
“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess.</p><p>
“It’s a mineral, I THINK,” said
Alice.</p><p>
“Of course it is,” said the Duchess,
who agreed to everything that Alice
said. “There’s a large mustard-mine
near here. And the moral of that is
—”</p><p>
“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice,
who wasn’t listening, “It’s a vegetable.</p><p>
 It doesn’t look like a vegetable,
but it is.”</p><p>
“I quite agree with you,” said the
Duchess, “and the moral of that is
—”</p><p>
	But here, to Alice’s great surprise,
the Duchess suddenly stopped
talking, and her arm began to tremble.
Alice looked up and saw the
Queen who was standing in front of
them and frowning like a thunderstorm.</p><p>
“A fine day, your Majesty!” the
Duchess began in a low, weak voice.</p><p>
“Now, you may choose,” shouted
the Queen, “either you or your head
must be off, and immediately! Take
your choice!”</p><p>
The Duchess took her choice, and
in a moment she was gone.</p><p>
“Let’s go on with the game,” the
Queen said to Alice; Alice was too
frightened to say a word, so she
slowly followed her back to the croquet-
ground.</p><p>
Without the Queen the other
guests were having a rest: however,
when they saw her, they hurried back
to the game because the delay could
cost them their lives.</p><p>
The game continued, but as the
Queen often shouted her favourite
“Off with his head!” or “Off with her
head!” very soon all the players, except
the King, the Queen, and Alice,
were under arrest.</p><p>
	Then the Queen said to Alice,
“Have you seen the Mock Turtle
yet?”</p><p>
“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even
know what a Mock Turtle is.”</p><p>
“It’s the thing what Mock Turtle
Soup is made from,” said the Queen.</p><p>
“I never saw one, or heard of
one,” said Alice.</p><p>
“Come on, then,” said the Queen,
“and he will tell you his history.”
As they walked off together, Alice
heard the King say in a low voice
to the company, “You are all pardoned.</p><p>
” “THAT’S a good thing!” she
said to herself.</p><p>
Very soon they came to a Gryphon.</p><p>
“Take this young lady to see
the Mock Turtle and to hear his
history. I must go back,” the Queen
said, and Alice was left alone with the
Gryphon. She did not quite like the
look of the creature, so she waited.
The Gryphon watched the Queen,
and when she was out of sight, it
chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon.
“What IS the fun?” said Alice.</p><p>
	“Well, SHE,” said the Gryphon.
“they never execute anybody, you
know. Come on!”
When they saw the Mock Turtle
in the distance, he was sitting sad
and lonely, and as they came nearer,
Alice heard that he was sighing as if
his heart would break. She pitied
him deeply.</p><p>
“What is his sorrow?” she asked
the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered,
“Well, he hasn’t got any
sorrow, you know. Come on!”</p><p>
So they went up to the Mock Turtle,
who looked at them with large
eyes full of tears but said nothing.</p><p>
“This young lady,” said the Gryphon,
“wants to know your history.”</p><p>
“I’ll tell it to her,” said the Mock
Turtle. “Sit down, both of you,
and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.</p><p>
” So they sat down, and nobody
spoke for some minutes. Alice
thought to herself, “I don’t see how
he can EVEN finish if he doesn’t begin.”
But she waited patiently.</p><p>
“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at
last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real
Turtle.”</p><p>
“When we were little,” the Mock
Turtle went on after a very long
pause, “we went to school in the sea.
We had the best teachers — in fact,
we went to school every day —”</p><p>
	“I’VE been to a day-school, too,”
said Alice. “We learned French and
music as extras.”</p><p>
“And washing?” asked the Mock
Turtle.</p><p>
“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.
“Ah! Then your school wasn’t a
really good school,” said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief.</p><p>
“I couldn’t afford to learn washing.”
said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh.</p><p>
“Then what did you learn?” asked
Alice.</p><p>
“Well, there was Mystery,” the
Mock Turtle replied, “— Mystery, ancient
and modern, with Seaography.</p><p>
An old master taught us Drawling,
Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”</p><p>
“What was THAT like?” said Alice.</p><p>
“Well, I can’t show it you myself,”
the Mock Turtle said, “I’m
too stiff. And the Gryphon never
learnt it.”</p><p>
“Had no time,” said the Gryphon.</p><p>
“And how many hours a day did
you have lessons?” said Alice.</p><p>
“Ten hours the first day,” said
the Mock Turtle, “nine the next, and
so on.”</p><p>
“What a curious plan!” exclaimed
Alice.</p><p>
“That’s the reason why they’re
called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked,
“because they lessen from
day to day.”</p><p>
This was quite a new idea to Alice,
and she thought it over a little before
asking, “Then was the eleventh
day a holiday?”</p><p>
“Of course it was,” said the Mock
Turtle.</p><p>
“And what was on the twelfth?”
Alice went on eagerly.</p><p>
“That’s enough about lessons,”
the Gryphon interrupted, “tell her
something about the games now.”</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 10.</span> The Lobster Quadrille</h3>
<div>

<p>
	The Mock Turtle sighed deeply
again. He looked at Alice and tried
to speak, but for a minute or two he
couldn’t. At last the Mock Turtle
went on with tears running down his
cheeks. “You have not lived much under
the sea, so you have no idea what a
delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille
is!” said the Mock Turtle.
“It must be a very pretty dance,”
said Alice timidly.</p><p>
“Would you like to see a little of
it?” asked the sad creature.</p><p>
“Very much,” said Alice.</p><p>
“Come, let’s try the first figure!”
said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.</p><p>
“We can do without lobsters, you
know. Who shall sing?”</p><p>
“Oh, YOU sing,” said the Gryphon.</p><p>
“I’ve forgotten the words.”</p><p>
So they began solemnly dancing
round and round Alice while the Mock
Turtle sang very slowly and sadly. The
dance was long and dull. So Alice felt
very glad when it was over at last,
and she said, “Thank you, it’s a very
interesting dance to watch.”</p><p>
Suddenly, the Gryphon said,
“Come, let’s hear some of YOUR
adventures.”</p><p>
“I could tell you my adventures —
beginning from this morning,” said
Alice a little timidly, “but it’s no use
going back to yesterday because I
was a different person then.”
“Explain all that,” demanded the
Mock Turtle.</p><p>
	“No, no! The adventures first,”
said the Gryphon in an impatient tone, 
“explanations take such a long
time.”</p><p>
So Alice began telling them her
adventures from the time when she
first saw the White Rabbit. She was
a little nervous about it at first because
the two creatures came so close
to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so wide, but
she gained courage and went on. Her
listeners were perfectly quiet all the
time.</p><p>
Then the Mock Turtle said thoughtfully,
“I would like to hear her try and
repeat something now. Tell her to begin.</p><p>
” And he looked at the Gryphon.</p><p>
“Stand up and repeat ,TIS THE
VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,” said
the Gryphon.</p><p>
“I could as well be at school now,”
thought Alice. However, she got
up and began to repeat it, but her
head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille
that she didn’t think what she
was saying, so the words were very
strange: —</p><p>
	“It is the voice of the Lobster; I
heard him declare,</p><p>
	‘You have baked me too brown, I
must sugar my hair.’</p><p>
	As a duck with its eyelids, so he with
his nose</p><p>
	Trims his belt and his buttons, and
turns out his toes.”</p><p>
	“That’s different from what I
said when I was a child,” said the
Gryphon.</p><p>
“Well, I never heard it before,”
said the Mock Turtle, “but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.”</p><p>
Alice said nothing; she had sat
down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER
happen in a natural way again.
“I would like to have an explanation,”
said the Mock Turtle.</p><p>
“She can’t explain it,” said the
Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the
next verse.”</p><p>
“But about his toes?” the Mock
Turtle asked again. “How COULD
he turn them out with his nose, you
know?”</p><p>
“It’s the first position in dancing.”
Alice said, but she was greatly puzzled
by the whole thing and wanted so
much to change the subject.</p><p>
	“Go on with the next verse,” the
Gryphon repeated impatiently, “it
begins ‘I passed by his garden.’”
Alice felt sure it would all be
wrong too, but she was ready to
continue when suddenly the Mock
Turtle interrupted her, “What IS
the use of repeating all those things
if you don’t explain them? It’s the
most confusing thing I ever heard!”</p><p>
“Yes, I think you’d better stop
it,” said the Gryphon, and Alice was
very glad to do so.</p><p>
“Shall we try another figure of
the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon
went on. “Or would you like the Mock
Turtle to sing you a song?”</p><p>
“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock
Turtle would be so kind,” Alice replied,
so fast that the Gryphon said,
in a rather offended tone, “Hm! Sing
her ‘Turtle Soup’, then, old fellow.”
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and
began to sing.</p><p>
Suddenly, a cry “The trial’s beginning!”
was heard in the distance.</p><p>
“Come on!” cried the Gryphon and,
taking Alice by the hand, hurried
off, without waiting for the end of
the song.</p><p>
“What trial is it?” Alice tried to
ask as she ran, but the Gryphon
only answered “Come on!” and they
ran faster.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 11.</span> Who Stole the Tarts?</h3>
<div>

<p>
	When they arrived, the King and
Queen of Hearts were sitting on their
throne. Around them was a great
crowd — different little birds and
creatures, as well as the whole pack
of cards: the Knave was standing before
them; he was in chains, and on
each his side there was a soldier, and
near the King was the White Rabbit.
In the very middle of the court was a
table, with a large dish of tarts on it:
they looked so delicious, that Alice
felt quite hungry looking at them. “I
hope the trial will be finished soon,”
she thought, “and everybody can have
the refreshments!” But it seemed
impossible, so she began looking at
everything about her to pass away
the time.</p><p>
Alice had never been in a court
of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was
glad that she knew the name of
nearly everything there. “That’s the
judge,” she said to herself, “because
he is wearing a great wig.”</p><p>
The judge, by the way, was the
King, and his crown was put on over
the wig.</p><p>
“And that’s the jury-box,” thought
Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”
(she called them “creatures,”, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,)
 “I suppose they
are the jurors.” She felt very proud
of her knowledge.</p><p>
	The twelve jurors were busy writing
something. “What are they
doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon.
“They’re writing down their
names,” the Gryphon whispered in
reply, “because they are afraid of
forgetting them before the end of
the trial.”</p><p>
“Stupid things!” Alice began in
a loud voice, but she stopped immediately
because the White Rabbit
cried out, “Silence in the court!” and
the King put on his spectacles and
looked round.</p><p>
“Herald, read the accusation!”
said the King.</p><p>
And the White Rabbit began to
read: —</p><p>
“The Queen of Hearts, she made
some tarts,</p><p>
All on a summer day:</p><p>
The Knave of Hearts, he stole
those tarts,
And took them quite away!”</p><p>
“Give your verdict,” the King
said to the jury.</p><p>
“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit
hastily interrupted.</p><p>
“Call the first witness,” said the
King, and the White Rabbit called
out, “First witness!”</p><p>
	The first witness was the Hatter.
He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in
the other.</p><p>
“I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he
began, “for bringing these things
here: but I haven’t finished my tea
yet.”</p><p>
“It’s not good,” said the King.
“When did you begin?”</p><p>
The Hatter looked at the March
Hare, who was in the court too
with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of
March, I think it was,” he said.</p><p>
“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.</p><p>
“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.</p><p>
“Write that down,” the King said
to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates.</p><p>
“Take off your hat,” the King said
to the Hatter.</p><p>
“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.</p><p>
“I sell them,” the Hatter added as
an explanation. “I’ve no hats of my
own. I’m a hatter.”</p><p>
Here the Queen put on her spectacles
and began staring at the Hatter,
who became pale.</p><p>
“Give your evidence,” said the
King, “and don’t be nervous, or
you’ll be executed right now.”
These words frightened the witness
even more so that he bit a large
piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.</p><p>
	Just at this moment Alice had a
very curious feeling, which puzzled
her greatly until she understood
what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and at first she
wanted to get up and leave the court,
but then she decided to stay where
she was.</p><p>
“Give your evidence,” the King repeated
angrily, “or you’ll be executed,
whether you’re nervous or not.”</p><p>
“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,”
the Hatter began, in a trembling
voice, “— and I hadn’t begun my
tea — about a week or so ago ...”</p><p>
“If that’s all you know about it,
you may sit down,” the King said.</p><p>
“I’d rather finish my tea,” said
the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list
of singers.</p><p>
“You may go,” said the King, and
the Hatter hurriedly left the court.</p><p>
“— and just take his head off
outside,” the Queen added to one of
the officers, but the Hatter was out
of sight before the officer could get
to the door.</p><p>
“Call the next witness!” said the
King.</p><p>
The next witness was the Duchess’s
cook. She carried the pepper-
box in her hand, and the people
near the door began sneezing all
at once.</p><p>
	“Give your evidence,” said the
King.</p><p>
“I can’t,” said the cook.</p><p>
The King looked anxiously at the
White Rabbit, who said in a low
voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine
THIS witness.”</p><p>
“Well,” the king said in a deep
voice, “What are tarts made of?”</p><p>
“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.</p><p>
“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind
her.</p><p>
“Behead that Dormouse! Turn that
Dormouse out of court! Off with his
whiskers!” the Queen screamed.</p><p>
For some minutes the whole court
was in confusion, and the cook disappeared.</p><p>
“Never mind!” said the King, with
great relief. “Call the next witness.”
And he added to the Queen, “Really,
my dear, YOU must cross-examine
the next witness. I have a headache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit
as he looked into the list, feeling
very curious to see the next witness,
“— they haven’t got much evidence
YET,” she said to herself. Imagine
her surprise, when the White Rabbit
read out very loudly the name:
“Alice!”</p>

<div>

<p>
	“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting
how large she had grown in the
last few minutes, and she jumped up
in such a hurry that the edge of her
skirt upset all the jurymen on to the
heads of the crowd below.</p><p>
“Oh, I BEG your pardon!” she
exclaimed in great worry and began
picking them up as quickly as she
could.</p><p>
“The trial cannot continue,” said
the King in a very serious voice, “until
all the jurymen are back in their
places — ALL,” he repeated.
As soon as the jury had a little
recovered from the shock, they started
writing down the history of the
accident.</p><p>
“What do you know about this?”
the King said to Alice.</p><p>
“Nothing,” said Alice.</p><p>
“Nothing AT ALL?” persisted the
King.</p><p>
“Nothing at all,” said Alice.</p><p>
“That’s very important,” the King
said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down
when the White Rabbit interrupted.</p><p>
“UNimportant, your Majesty
means, of course,” he said in a very
respectful tone.</p><p>
“UNimportant, of course, I
meant,” the King hastily said.</p><p>
	Some of the jury wrote it down
“important,” and some “unimportant.”
Alice could see this as she was
near enough. “But it doesn’t matter,”
she thought to herself.</p><p>
At this moment the King cried
out “Silence!” and read out from his
book:</p><p>
“Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS
MORE THAN A MILE HIGH MUST
LEAVE THE COURT.”</p><p>
Everybody looked at Alice.</p><p>
“I’M not a mile high,” said Alice.</p><p>
“You are,” said the King.</p><p>
“Nearly two miles high,” added the
Queen.</p><p>
“Well, I won’t go, at any rate,”
said Alice.</p><p>
“Besides, that’s not a usual rule:
you invented it just now.”</p><p>
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,”
said the King.</p><p>
“Then it must be Number One,”
said Alice.</p><p>
The King turned pale and closed
his note-book hastily. “Read your
verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low,
trembling voice.</p><p>
“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence
first — verdict after it.”</p><p>
“Nonsense!” said Alice loudly.</p><p>
“The sentence can’t go first!”</p><p>
“Hold your tongue!” said the
Queen, turning dark red.</p><p>
“I won’t!” said Alice.</p><p>
	“Off with her head!” the Queen
shouted as loudly as she could. Nobody
moved.</p><p>
“Who is afraid of you?” said Alice,
(she was her full size by this time.)
“You’re just a pack of cards!”
At this moment the whole pack
went up into the air and came flying
down on her: she screamed and woke
up on the bank of the river. Her sister
was sitting near her and gently
brushing away some dry leaves that
had fell down from the trees on Alice’s
face.</p><p>
“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her
sister. “What a long sleep you’ve
had!”</p><p>
“Oh, I’ve had such a curious
dream!” said Alice, and she told her
sister all her strange adventures as
she could remember them. When
she finished, her sister kissed her
and said, “It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly, but it’s getting late
and it’s time for tea.” So they got
up and went home. And all their
way back Alice was thinking about
her wonderful and unusual dream
that she would never forget.</p>

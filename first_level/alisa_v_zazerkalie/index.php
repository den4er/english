		<h2>"THROUGH THE LOOKINGGLASS, AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE" <span>Lewis Carroll</span></h2>
		
<h3><span>Chapter 1.</span> Looking-Glass House</h3>
<div>		

<p>		The old cat Dinah was washing
the white kitten, called Snowdrop.
Dinah was rubbing its face all over
beginning at the nose and it was lying
quite still and trying to purr.
Snowdrop felt that it was all for its
own good. The black kitten, called
Kitty, was already washed and clean.
Alice was sitting in the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself
and half asleep. And Kitty was playing
with a ball of worsted rolling it
up and down on the floor. The whole
room was in a mess.</p><p>
‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’
cried Alice and caught up the kitten.
She gave it a little kiss. ‘Where are
your manners? Dinah has to teach
you how to behave!’ she added and
sat back into the arm-chair. She began
winding up the ball again. Alice
was talking all the time, sometimes
to the kitten, and sometimes to herself.
 Kitty sat next to her and
watched the process.</p><p>
		‘Oh, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice
went on, ‘when I saw all the mischief
you had done, I was nearly opening
the window and putting you out
into the snow! You deserve it, you
little darling! What have you got to
say for yourself? I’m going to tell
you all your faults. Number one:
you squeaked twice when Dinah was
washing your face this morning.
You can’t deny it, Kitty! Number
two: you pulled Snowdrop away by
the tail when I gave it some milk!
Number three: you unwound the
worsted while I wasn’t looking!’
‘Three faults, Kitty! I will punish
you some day!’</p><p>
‘Oh, Kitty, can you play chess?
Don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking
you seriously. Because, when we
were playing just now, you watched
as if you understood everything. I
said “Check!” and you purred! Kitty,
dear, let’s pretend...’
“Let’s pretend...” was Alice’s favourite
phrase.</p><p>
‘Let’s pretend that you’re the
Red Queen! I think if you sit like
this, you’ll look exactly like her. Try,
dear!’ And Alice took the Red Queen
and showed it to the kitten. But the
kitten couldn’t sit properly. In order
to punish it, Alice held it up to the
Looking-glass ‘If you’re not good,’she said, ‘I’ll put you through into
Looking-glass House. How would
you like that?’</p><p>
		‘Now, Kitty, I’ll tell you everything
about Looking-glass House.
First, you can see a room through
the glass... it’s just the same as our
living room, only the things go the
other way. I can see all of it when I
get upon a chair... all except the bit
behind the fireplace. Oh! I wish I
could see that bit! I want to know if
they have a fire in the winter. Well,
the books are like our books, only the
words go the wrong way.’</p><p>
‘Would you like to live in Lookingglass
House, Kitty? I wonder if they
would give you milk there. Perhaps
Looking-glass milk isn’t good. Oh,
Kitty! How nice it would be if we
could only get through into Lookingglass
House! I’m sure there are such
beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend
we can find a way into it, Kitty. Look,
it’s turning into a sort of mist! It will
be easy to get through... ’.</p><p>
In another moment Alice was
through the glass, and jumped down
into the Looking-glass room. First
she looked if there was a fire in the
fireplace. And she was pleased when
she saw a real fire.</p><p>
Then she began looking about —
it was very interesting there! For example,
the pictures on the wall were
alive, and the clock on the chimney
 piece had got the face of a little old
man, and he smiled at her.</p><p>
		She noticed some chessmen on the
floor and thought that it wasn’t very
tidy there. But in another moment,
she understood that they were alive!</p><p>
The chessmen were walking about!
‘Here are the Red King and the
Red Queen,’ Alice whispered, ‘and
there are the White King and the
White Queen... and here two castles
are walking arm in arm. I
don’t think they can hear me!’ she
went on, as she put her head closer
down. ‘And I’m sure they can’t see
me. I feel as if I were invisible... ’
Something began squeaking
on the table behind Alice, and she
turned her head and saw that one of
the White Pawns fell down.</p><p>
‘It is the voice of my child!’ the
White Queen cried out. ‘My dear
Lily!’</p><p>
Alice wanted to help the White
Queen, and she picked up the Queen
and set her on the table to her noisy
little daughter.</p><p>
The journey through the air
frightened the White Queen and for
a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence.
But then she cried, ‘Mind the volcano!’</p><p>

‘What volcano?’ said the White
King, he looked into the fire, as if he
thought there was a volcano.</p><p>
		‘It blew me up,’ said the White
Queen, who was still frightened.
‘Come up the regular way!’</p><p>
Alice watched the White King —
he began coming up very slowly.
Alice said, ‘I will help you!’ But he
couldn’t hear and see her. Alice
picked him up very gently, and lifted
him. But, before she put him on the
table, she began cleaning him — he
was very dirty because of ashes. Of
course, he was frightened too — he
was hanging in the air and something
was cleaning him!</p><p>
Alice set him on the table near
the Queen. The White King fell on
his back and lay perfectly still.
Alice worried about him and started
looking for some water for him.
However, she found only a bottle
of ink, and when she went back the
White King had already recovered.
He and the Queen were talking together
in a frightened whisper...
so low, that Alice could hardly hear
what they were saying.</p><p>
The King said: ‘I turned cold to
the very ends of my whiskers!’</p><p>
‘You haven’t got any whiskers,’
the Queen said.</p><p>
‘This horrible moment,’ the King
went on, ‘I will never, never forget!’</p><p>
‘You will,’ the Queen said, ‘if
you don’t make a note of it.’ 
The King took a big note-book out
of his pocket, and began writing. A
sudden thought came to Alice, and she
took the end of his pencil and began
writing for him.</p><p>
The poor King look puzzled and
unhappy, and at last he said: ‘My
dear! I need another pencil. It
writes what I don’t want to write!’
The Queen looked into the book —
‘The White Knight is sliding down
the poker. He balances very badly.’
‘But these aren’t your thoughts!’
There was a book near Alice on
the table, and she opened it and read.</p><p>

			</p><p> </p><p>	
			YKCOWREBBAJ</p><p>
			sevot yhtils eht dna,gillirb sawT</p><p>

			,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA</p><p>
			.ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA</p><p> </p><p>

		At first she was puzzled very much, but then she understood
		everything. ‘It’s a Looking-glass book, of course!
		And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right
		way again.” This was the poem that Alice read.</p><p> </p><p>

			JABBERWOCKY</p><p>
			’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p><p>
			Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p><p>
			All mimsy were the borogoves,</p><p>
			And the mome raths outgrabe.</p><p>

		‘It is very pretty,’ Alice said,
‘but it’s very hard to understand! It
seems to fill my head with ideas...
only I don’t exactly know what they
are!’</p><p>
‘Oh!’ thought Alice suddenly,
‘I want to see the rest of the house!
Let’s start with the garden first!’
and ran downstairs.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 2.</span> The Garden of Live Flowers</h3>
<div>

<p>		‘I will see the garden better,’
said Alice to herself, ‘if I get to the
top of that hill. And there is a path
that leads straight to it. But... how
it twists! Well, this turn goes to the
hill, I think... no, it doesn’t! It goes
straight back to the house! Well
then, I’ll try it the other way.’
And so she did: she followed the
path, but always came back to the
house.</p><p>
‘No!’ Alice said, looking up at
the house. ‘I don’t want to go in
yet. I will come back home through
Looking-glass and it will be the end
of my adventures!’</p><p>
However, there was the hill full
in sight, so she started again. This
time she passed large flower-bed,
with a border of daisies, and a willow-
tree growing in the middle.</p><p>
‘O Tiger-lily,’ said Alice to one
flower that was waving in the wind,
‘I wish you could talk!</p><p>
		‘We can talk,’ said the Tiger-lily:</p><p>
‘when there is someone to talk to.’
Alice was so surprised that she
could not speak for a minute. Then
she asked, ‘And can all the flowers
talk?’ ‘Yes, as well as you can,’ said
the Tiger-lily.</p><p>
‘We don’t think it’s polite to start
first,’ said the Rose, ‘and I was wondering
if you would speak! I said to
myself, “Her face has got some sense
in it, although it’s not very clever!”
Still, your colour is good.’</p><p>
‘I don’t care about the colour,’
the Tiger-lily said. ‘If only her petals
curled up a little more!’</p><p>
Alice didn’t like when someone
criticized her, so she began asking
questions. ‘Are you frightened that
nobody takes care of you?’</p><p>
‘There’s the tree in the middle,’
said the Rose: ‘what else is it good
for?’</p><p>
‘But what can it do, if any danger
comes?’ Alice asked.</p><p>
‘It can bark,’ said the Rose.</p><p>
‘It says “Bough-wough!”’ cried a
Daisy.</p><p>
‘Didn’t you know that?’ cried
another Daisy, and they all began
shouting together.</p><p>
‘Silence!’ cried the Tiger-lily,
waving itself from side to side.
‘Never mind!’ Alice said and
whispered to the daisies, ‘If you don’t
hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!’</p><p>
		There was silence for a moment,
and several of the pink daisies became
white.</p><p>
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.</p><p>
‘The daisies are worst of all. When one
speaks, they all begin together!’</p><p>
‘How can you talk so well?’ Alice
asked. ‘I visited many gardens, but
flowers couldn’t talk.’</p><p>
‘Put your hand down, and feel the
ground,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘Then
you’ll know why.’</p><p>
Alice did so. ‘It’s very hard,’ she
said.</p><p>
‘In most gardens,’ the Tiger-lily
said, ‘the flower-beds are too soft...
so that the flowers are always asleep.’
This sounded a very good reason,
and Alice was quite pleased to know
it. ‘I never thought of that before!’
she said.</p><p>
‘I think that you never think at
all,’ the Rose said.</p><p>
‘Hold your tongue!’ cried the
Tiger-lily.</p><p>
‘Are there any more people in the
garden besides me?’ Alice asked,
trying not to notice the Rose’s last
remark.</p><p>
‘There’s one other flower in the garden
that can move like you,’ said the
Rose. ‘I wonder how you do it...’</p><p>
‘Is she like me?’ Alice asked. She
thought: “There’s another little girl
in the garden somewhere!”</p><p>
		‘Well, she has the same shape as
you,’ the Rose said, ‘but she is red...
and her petals are shorter.’</p><p>
‘Does she ever come here?’</p><p>
‘I think you will see her soon,’
said the Rose. ‘She has thorns.’</p><p>
‘Where does she wear the thorns?’
Alice asked with some curiosity.</p><p>
‘All round her head, of course,’
the Rose replied. ‘I wonder why you
haven’t got them. Oh, she’s coming!
 I hear her footsteps!’</p><p>
Alice looked round, and saw that
it was the Red Queen. ‘She has grown
up!’ was her first thought. She had
indeed: when Alice first found her
in the ashes, she had been only three
inches high... and now she was taller
than Alice!</p><p>
‘I think I’ll go and meet her,’ said
Alice, although the flowers were interesting
too, she decided to have a
talk with a real Queen.</p><p>
‘You can’t do that,’ said the Rose:</p><p>
‘You should walk the other way.’</p><p>
“Nonsense”, Alice thought, so
she said nothing, and went towards
the Red Queen. To her surprise, she
lost sight of her for a moment, and
walked in at the front-door again.
Alice was surprised a lot and tried
to walk the opposite direction.</p><p>
In a minute she was at the hill
with the Red Queen.</p><p>
‘Where do you come from?’ asked
the Red Queen. ‘And where are you 
going? Look up, speak nicely, and
don’t twiddle your fingers!’</p><p>
		Alice explained that she had lost
her way.</p><p>
‘I don’t know what you mean by
your way,’ said the Queen: ‘all the
ways belong to me... but why did
you come here at all?’ she added.
‘Curtsey while you’re thinking what
to say, it saves time.’</p><p>
“I’ll try it when I go home,’ Alice
thought to herself. ‘the next time
I’m a little late for dinner.”</p><p>
‘It’s time for you to answer
now,’ the Queen said, looking at her
watch: ‘open your mouth wider when
you speak, and always say “your
Majesty”.’</p><p>
‘I only wanted to see the garden,
your Majesty... ’</p><p>
‘That’s right,’ said the Queen and
patted her on the head. Alice didn’t
like it at all. ‘Although I have seen
gardens, compared with which this
would be a wilderness.’</p><p>
Alice didn’t want to argue and
went on: ‘... and I thought I’d try and
find my way to the top of that hill...’</p><p>
‘When you say “hill”,’ the Queen
said, ‘I can show you hills, in comparison
with which you will call that
a valley.’</p><p>
‘No, it will be nonsense... ’</p><p>
The Red Queen shook her head,
‘You may call it “nonsense” if you
like,’ she said, ‘ but I have heard 
nonsense, compared with which
that would be as sensible as a dictionary!’</p><p>
		Alice curtseyed again, because
she was afraid that the Queen could
be offended. And they walked on in
silence and reached the top of the little
hill.</p><p>
For some time Alice stood and
said nothing, looking out in all directions
over the country. There were
tiny little brooks — they ran straight
across the country from side to side,
and the ground between was divided
up into squares by a number of little
green hedges.</p><p>
‘It is just like a large chessboard!’
Alice said at last. ‘It’s a great
huge game of chess. Oh, what fun it
is! How I wish I were one of them! I
would like even to be a Pawn, if only
I can join... although, of course, I’d
like to be a Queen!’</p><p>
The Red Queen only smiled, and
said, ‘That’s easy. You can be the
White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, because
Lily is too young to play; and
you’re in the Second Square: when
you get to the Eighth Square you’ll
be a Queen... ’ Just at this moment
they began to run.</p><p>
They were running hand in hand,
and the Queen went very fast and she
cried to Alice ‘Faster! Faster!’. Alice
felt that she could not go faster.</p><p>
		The most curious thing was, that
the trees and the other things round
them never changed their places at
all!</p><p>
The Queen kept crying ‘Faster!
Faster!’.</p><p>
‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice asked
at last.</p><p>
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen said.
‘Faster!’ And they ran in silence, the
wind was whistling in Alice’s ears,
and almost blowing her hair off her
head.</p><p>
‘Now! Now!’ cried the Queen.</p><p>
‘Faster! Faster!’ And they went so
fast that they hardly touched the
ground with their feet! Suddenly
they stopped — Alice was sitting on
the ground.</p><p>
The Queen said kindly, ‘You may
rest a little now.’</p><p>
Alice looked round her in great
surprise. ‘We have been under
this tree the whole time! Nothing
changed!’</p><p>
‘Of course,’ said the Queen.</p><p>
‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice,
‘you would be somewhere else... if
you ran very fast for a long time!’
‘What a slow country!’ said the
Queen. ‘Here we have to run in order
to stay in the same place. If you
want to get somewhere else, you
must run faster!’</p><p>
‘I’m pleased to stay here... only I
am so hot and thirsty!’ said Alice.</p><p>
		The Queen took a little box out of
her pocket. ‘Have a biscuit?’
Alice thought it would not be polite
to say ‘No,’ although it wasn’t
at all what she wanted. She took and
ate it, but it was very dry.</p><p>
‘While you’re refreshing yourself,’
said the Queen, ‘I will measure
the ground.’ And she took a ribbon
out of her pocket, and began measuring
the ground.</p><p>
‘Now I will give you your directions...
have another biscuit?’</p><p>
‘No, thank you,’ said Alice, ‘one
is enough!’</p><p>
‘You are not thirsty any more, I
hope?’ said the Queen.</p><p>
Alice did not know what to say,
but the Queen did not wait for an
answer and went on. ‘You know that
a pawn goes two squares in its first
move. So you will go very quickly
through the Third Square... by
train, I think. Well, the Fourth
Square belongs to Tweedledum
and Tweedledee. The Fifth one is
mostly watered. The Sixth Square
belongs to Humpty Dumpty. The
Seventh Square is a forest... however,
one of the Knights will show you the 
way... and in the Eighth
Square we will be Queens together,
and have a lot of fun!’ Alice got up
and curtseyed, and sat down again.</p><p> 
‘Speak French when you don’t
know what to say, turn out your toes
as you walk, and remember who you
are!’ The Red Queen turned for a moment
to say ‘good-bye,’ and then disappeared.
Maybe she vanished into the air,
or maybe she ran quickly into the
forest, Alice couldn’t understand,
but she had gone. And Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn, and
soon she would make a move.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 3.</span> Looking-Glass Insects</h3>
<div>

<p>		Of course the first thing to do was
to explore the country that Alice was
going to travel through. ‘It’s something
like learning geography,’</p><p>
thought Alice. ‘Main rivers... there
are none. Main mountains... I’m on
the only one, but I don’t think it’s got
any name. Main towns... oh, what are
those creatures that are making honey
down there? They can’t be bees...
but nobody can see bees from here,
you know... ’ and for some time she
stood silent, watching one of them
that was flying among the flowers.</p><p>
‘It looks like a simple bee,’ thought
Alice. But in fact it was an elephant...
as Alice soon found out. ‘And how
enormous these flowers can be!’ she
thought. ‘Something like houses!</p><p>
I think I’ll go down and... or, no...
I can’t go without a long branch to
brush them away... and how funny
it’ll be when they ask me at home
how I like my walk. I’ll say... “Oh,
I liked it very much... Only it was
very dusty and hot, and the elephants
were flying around!”’</p><p>
‘Maybe I may visit the elephants
later. Besides, I want to get into the
Third Square!’</p><p>
So she ran down the hill and
jumped over the first of the six little
brooks...</p><p>
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard.
In a moment everybody showed their
tickets. There were a lot of people,
animals and insects in the carriage.</p><p>
‘Now then! Show your ticket,
child!’ the Guard went on, looking
angrily at Alice. And many voices
all said together (‘like the chorus of
a song,’ thought Alice), ‘Don’t keep
him waiting, child! Time is worth a
thousand pounds a minute!’</p><p>
‘I haven’t got a ticket,’
		‘I haven’t got a ticket,’ Alice
said, ‘there wasn’t a ticket-office
where I came from.” And again the chorus
 of voices went on. ‘There
wasn’t room for a ticket office
where she came from. The land
there is worth a thousand pounds
an inch!’</p><p>
‘Don’t make excuses,’ said the
Guard.</p><p>
He was looking at her, first
through a telescope, then through
a microscope, and then through an
opera-glass. At last he said, ‘You’re
travelling the wrong way,’ and went
away.</p><p>
‘A child,’ said the gentleman sitting
next to her (he was dressed in
white paper),‘should know which
way she’s going, even if she doesn’t
know her own name!’</p><p>
A Goat, that was sitting next to
the gentleman in white, said in a loud
voice, ‘She has to know her way to
the ticket-office, even if she doesn’t
know her alphabet!’</p><p>
There was a Beetle who was sitting
next to the Goat and he said ‘She
has to go back from here as luggage!’
And after that other voices went
on, ‘She must go by post...’ ‘She
must be sent as a message by the
telegraph...’ and so on.</p><p>
		But the gentleman dressed in
white paper whispered in her ear,
‘Never mind what they all say, my dear,
 but take a return-ticket every
time the train stops.”</p><p>
‘But I didn’t want...’ Alice began.</p><p>
‘I was in a wood just now, and I
wish I could get back there.’</p><p>
‘You might make a joke on that,
said the little voice close to her ear:</p><p>
‘something about “you would if you
could,” you know. I know you are a
friend,’ the little voice went on. ‘And
you won’t hurt me, although I am an
insect.’</p><p>
‘What kind of insect?’ Alice
asked. She wanted to know if it could
sting or not, she thought it wouldn’t
be polite to ask such questions. But
at that moment there was a shrill
scream from the engine, and everybody
jumped up.</p><p>
The Horse said, ‘It’s only a
brook and we have to jump it over.’
Everybody was satisfied with
this, although Alice was nervous.
‘However, it’ll take us into the
Fourth Square, that’s great!’ she
said to herself. In another moment
the carriage rose up into the air...
And the next moment she was sitting
under a tree... with the Gnat (it
was that insect in the train). It was
sitting on a branch over her head and
fanning her with its wings.</p><p>
		It was an enormous Gnat: ‘about
the size of a chicken,’ Alice thought.
‘...then you don’t like all insects?
the Gnat asked.</p><p>
‘I like them when they can talk,’
Alice said. ‘They don’t talk, where I
come from.’</p><p>
‘What kind of insects do you like
from where you come from?’ the
Gnat asked.</p><p>
‘I don’t like them at all,’ Alice
explained, ‘because I’m afraid of
them... at least the large kinds. But
I can tell you the names of some of
them.”</p><p>
‘Do they answer to their names?’
the Gnat asked.</p><p>
‘I don’t know...’</p><p>
‘What’s the use of having
names’ the Gnat said, ‘if they won’t
answer to them?’</p><p>
‘It’s useful to the people who
name them. If not, why do things
have names at all?’</p><p>
‘I can’t say,’ the Gnat said. ‘Here
they’ve got no names... however, go
on with your list of insects: you’re
wasting time.’</p><p>
‘Well, there’s the Horse-fly,’
Alice began.</p><p>
‘All right,’ said the Gnat: ‘here
you’ll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if
you look. It’s made of wood.’</p><p>
		‘What does it eat?’ Alice asked
with curiosity.</p><p>
‘Sawdust,’ said the Gnat. ‘Go on
with the list.’</p><p>
Alice looked at the Rockinghorse-
fly with great interest, then
she went on.</p><p>
‘And then there’s the Butterfly,’
Alice said.</p><p>
‘At your feet,’ said the Gnat,
‘you’ll see a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its
wings are thin slices of bread-andbutter,
its body is a crust, and its
head is a lump of sugar.’</p><p>
‘And what does it eat?’</p><p>
‘Weak tea with cream.’</p><p>
After this, Alice was silent for
a minute or two. The Gnat asked, ‘I
think you don’t want to lose your
name.’</p><p>
‘No, I don’t,’ Alice said. She was
a little nervous.</p><p>
‘And I don’t know,’ the Gnat went
on: ‘only think how convenient it
would be if you could go home without
a name! For example, if the
governess wanted to call you to your
lessons, she would say “come here...
,” and there she would have to stop,
because she didn’t know your name,
and of course you wouldn’t have to
go, you know.’</p><p>
‘That would never happen, I’m
sure,’ said Alice: ‘If she couldn’t 
remember my name, she’d call me
“Miss!”.’</p><p>
		‘Well, if she said “Miss,” and
didn’t say anything more,’ the Gnat
said, ‘of course you’d miss your lessons.
That’s a joke.’</p><p>
‘It’s a bad joke,’ said Alice.
But the Gnat only sighed, and
two large tears came rolling down its
cheeks.</p><p>
‘You shouldn’t make jokes,’
Alice said, ‘if it makes you so unhappy.’
Alice looked up, but the Gnat
wasn’t there! Alice got up and walked
on.</p><p>
Soon she came to an open field,
with a wood on the other side: it
looked much darker than the last
wood, and Alice was a little afraid.
However, she decided to go on: ‘I certainly
won’t go back’, she thought to
herself, ‘and this was the only way to
the Eighth Square.’</p><p>
‘Maybe this is the wood’, she said
to herself, ‘where things have no
names. I wonder what’ll become of
my name when I go in? I don’t want
to lose it... because someone will give
me another, and it would be ugly, of
course.’</p><p>
She reached the wood: it was very
cool there. ‘Well, anyway it’s good,’
she said and stopped under the trees,
‘not to be so hot, to get into the...
into what?’ she went on, she was very 
much surprised because she couldn’t
think of the word. ‘I mean to get
under the... under the... under
this!’ she touched trunk of the tree.</p><p>
		She stood silent for a minute,
thinking: then she suddenly said,
‘Then it really has happened! And
now, who am I? I can’t remember!’
Just then a Fawn came out: it
looked at Alice with its large gentle
eyes. It wasn’t frightened. ‘Here
then! Here then!’ Alice said, she
raised her hand and tried to stroke
it.</p><p>
‘What’s your name?’ the Fawn
said at last. Such a soft sweet voice
it had!</p><p>
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor
Alice. She answered, rather sadly, ‘I
don’t know.’</p><p>
‘Think again,’ it said, ‘that won’t
do.’</p><p>
Alice thought, but nothing came
of it. ‘Please, would you tell me
what is your name?’ she said. ‘I think
it can help me.’</p><p>
‘I’ll tell you, but not here,’ the
Fawn said. ‘I can’t remember.’
So they walked on together
through the wood. They came out
into another field, and here the Fawn
said, ‘I’m a Fawn! And you’re a human
child!’ and in another moment it
ran away.</p><p>
		Alice stood looking after it, she
was ready to cry because she lost her
dear friend so suddenly. ‘However,
I know my name now.’ she said,
‘Alice... Alice... I won’t forget it
again! And now, which way should I
go?’</p><p>
It was not very difficult, because
there was only one road
through the wood. She went on
and on, but then she saw two finger-
posts which were pointing
the same way, one was marked ‘To
Tweedledum’s house and the other
‘To the house of Tweedledee. ‘I
think,’ said Alice at last, ‘that they
live in the same house! But I can’t
stay there very long. I’ll just call
and say “how do you do?” and ask
them which way I should go. If I
could only get the Eighth Square
before it gets dark!’ So she went
on, till she saw two fat little men.
It was so suddenly! But in another
moment she understood that they
were Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 4.</span> Tweedledum and Tweedledee</h3>
<div>

<p>		They were standing under a
tree, each with an arm round the 
other’s neck. Alice knew which was
which, because one of them had ‘dum’
on his collar, and the other ‘dee’. ‘I
think they’ve got ‘Tweedle’ at the
back of the collar,’ she said to herself.
They stood so still that she forgot
that they were alive. She wanted to
look if the word ‘Tweedle’ was written
at the back of each collar, when
one, who had ‘dum’, said, ‘If you think
we’re wax-works, you should pay!’</p><p>
‘Contrariwise,’ added the one, who
had ‘dee’, ‘if you think we’re alive, you
should speak.’</p><p>
‘I’m very sorry,’ said Alice. The
words of the old song kept ringing
through her head like the ticking of a
clock:</p><p> </p><p>

			
		Tweedledum and Tweedledee</p><p>
		Agreed to have a battle;</p><p>
		For Tweedledum said Tweedledee</p><p>
		Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</p><p>
		Just then flew down a monstrous crow,</p><p>
		As black as a tar-barrel;</p><p>
		Which frightened both the heroes so,</p><p>
		They quite forgot their quarrel.</p><p> </p><p>
	

		‘I know what you’re thinking
about,’ said Tweedledum: ‘but it
isn’t so.’</p><p>
‘I was thinking,’ Alice said very
politely, ‘which was the best way
out of this wood. It’s getting dark.
Could you tell me, please?’
But the fat little men only looked
at each other and grinned.</p><p>
They looked like a couple of great
schoolboys, that Alice said, ‘First
Boy!’</p><p>
‘Nohow!’ Tweedledum cried.</p><p>
‘Next Boy!’ said Alice, although
she felt Tweedledee would only shout
out “Contrariwise!’ and so he did.</p><p>
‘You are wrong!’ cried
Tweedledum. ‘The first thing you
should do is to say “How do you do?”
and shake hands!’</p><p>
And the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they raised the
two hands that were free to shake
hands with Alice.</p><p>
Alice took both hands at once:
the next moment they were dancing
in a ring. It was very natural, and
she was not even surprised when
she heard music.</p><p>
The other two dancers were fat,
and soon they stopped. Then they let
go Alice’s hands, stood and looked
at her for a minute. </p><p>
‘I hope you’re not tired?’ she said
at last.</p><p>
‘Nohow. And thank you for asking,’
said Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘Do you like poetry?’ asked
Tweedledee.</p><p>
‘Yes... I like poetry,’ Alice said.
‘But could you tell me which road
leads out of the wood?’</p><p>
‘What can I read to her?’ asked
Tweedledee, he didn’t notice Alice’s
question.</p><p>
‘“The Walrus and the Carpenter”
is the longest,’ Tweedledum said.
Tweedledee began:</p><p>
‘The sun was shining... ’</p><p>
But Alice interrupted him. ‘If
it’s very long,’ she said, ‘would you
please tell me first which road...’
But Tweedledee smiled gently,
and began again:</p><p> </p><p>
		
		

		‘The sun was shining on the sea,</p><p>
		Shining with all his might:</p><p>
		He did his very best to make</p><p>
		The billows smooth and bright—</p><p>
		And this was odd, because it was</p><p>
		The middle of the night.</p><p> </p><p>

		The Walrus and the Carpenter</p><p>
		Were walking close at hand;</p><p>
		They wept like anything to see</p><p>	
		Such quantities of sand:</p><p>
		“If this were only cleared away,”</p><p>
		They said, “it would be grand!”</p><p> </p><p>

		“O Oysters, come and walk with us!”</p><p>
		The Walrus did beseech.</p><p>
		“A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,</p><p>
		Along the briny beach:</p><p>
		We cannot do with more than four,</p><p>
		To give a hand to each.”</p><p> </p><p>

		And four young Oysters hurried up,</p><p>
		All eager for the treat:</p><p>
		Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,</p><p>
		Their shoes were clean and neat—</p><p>
		And this was odd, because, you know,</p><p>
		They hadn’t any feet.</p><p>
		Four other Oysters followed them,</p><p>
		And yet another four;</p><p>
		And thick and fast they came at last,</p><p>
		And more, and more, and more—</p><p>
		All hopping through the frothy waves,</p><p>
		And scrambling to the shore.</p><p> </p><p>

		The Walrus and the Carpenter</p><p>
		Walked on a mile or so,</p><p>
		And then they rested on a rock</p><p>
		Conveniently low:</p><p>
		And all the little Oysters stood</p><p>
		And waited in a row.</p><p> </p><p>

		“The time has come,” the Walrus said,</p><p>
		“To talk of many things:</p><p>
		Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —</p><p>
		Of cabbages — and kings —</p><p>
		And why the sea is boiling hot —</p><p>
		And whether pigs have wings.”</p><p> </p><p>

		“But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried,</p><p>
		“Before we have our chat;</p><p>
		For some of us are out of breath,</p><p>
		And all of us are fat!”</p><p>
		“No hurry!” said the Carpenter.</p><p>
		They thanked him much for that.</p><p> </p><p>

		“A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said,</p><p>
		“Is what we chiefly need:</p><p>
		Pepper and vinegar besides</p><p>
		Are very good indeed —</p><p>
		Now if you’re ready, Oysters dear,</p><p>
		We can begin to feed.”</p><p>
		“But not on us!” the Oysters cried,</p><p>
		Turning a little blue.</p><p>
		“After such kindness, that would be</p><p>
		A dismal thing to do!”</p><p>
		“The night is fine,” the Walrus said.</p><p>
		“Do you admire the view?</p><p> </p><p>

		“It was so kind of you to come!</p><p>
		And you are very nice!”</p><p>
		The Carpenter said nothing but</p><p>
		“Cut us another slice:</p><p>
		I wish you were not quite so deaf—</p><p>
		I’ve had to ask you twice!”</p><p> </p><p>

		“It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,</p><p>
		“To play them such a trick,</p><p>
		After we’ve brought them out so far,</p><p>
		And made them trot so quick!”</p><p>
		The Carpenter said nothing but</p><p>
		“The butter’s spread too thick!”</p><p> </p><p>

		“I weep for you,” the Walrus said:</p><p> 
		“I deeply sympathize.”</p><p> 
		With sobs and tears he sorted out</p><p> 
		Those of the largest size,</p><p> 
		Holding his pocket-handkerchief</p><p> 
		Before his streaming eyes.</p><p> </p><p> 

		“O Oysters,” said the Carpenter,</p><p>
		“You’ve had a pleasant run!</p><p>
		Shall we be trotting home again?”</p><p>
		But answer came there none —</p><p>
		And this was scarcely odd, because</p><p>
		They’d eaten every one.’</p><p> </p><p>


		‘I like the Walrus best,’ said
Alice: ‘because he was a little sorry
for the poor oysters.’</p><p>
‘But he ate more than the
Carpenter,’ said Tweedledee. ‘You
see he held his handkerchief in front,
so that the Carpenter couldn’t count
how many he took: contrariwise.’</p><p>
‘That’s terrible!’ Alice cried.</p><p>
‘Then I like the Carpenter... if he
didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.’</p><p>
‘But he ate as many as he could get,’
said Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘Well! They’re both very unpleasant
characters... ’ Alice said. Here
she heard some noises. ‘Are there any
lions or tigers here?’ she asked. </p><p>
‘It’s only the Red King! He is
snoring,’ said Tweedledee.</p><p>
‘Come and look at him!’ the brothers
cried, and they each took one of
Alice’s hands, and showed her the
King, who was sleeping.</p><p>
‘Isn’t he lovely?” said Tweedledum.
Alice couldn’t say honestly. He
had a red night-cap, and he was lying
under the tree, and snoring loud.</p><p>
‘I’m afraid he’ll catch cold,’
said Alice, who was a very kind little
girl.</p><p>
‘He’s dreaming now,’ said
Tweedledee: ‘and what do you think
he’s dreaming about?’</p><p>
Alice said, ‘Nobody can guess
that.’</p><p>
‘About you!’ Tweedledee said,
clapping his hands. ‘You’re his
dream!’</p><p>
‘If the King wakes,’ added
Tweedledum, ‘you will disappear...
bang! And that’s it!’</p><p>
‘No, I won’t!’ Alice said. ‘Besides,
if I’m only his dream, what are you
then?’</p><p>
‘The same,’ said Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘The same,’ cried Tweedledee.</p><p>
He shouted this so loud that Alice
said, ‘Hush! You’ll wake him, I’m
afraid, if you make so much noise.’</p><p>
		‘Well, don’t be afraid,’ said
Tweedledum, ‘you’re only his dream.
You know very well you’re not real.’</p><p>
‘I am real!’ said Alice and began
to cry. ‘I know they’re talking nonsense,’
Alice thought to herself:</p><p>
‘and it’s foolish to cry about it.’
So she stopped crying, and went on
with a smile, ‘Anyway I need to get
out of the wood, it’s really getting
very dark. Do you think it’s going to
rain?’</p><p>
Tweedledum opened a large umbrella
over himself and his brother.</p><p>
‘No, I don’t think it is,’ he said:</p><p>
‘at least... not under the umbrella.
Nohow.’</p><p>
‘But it may rain outside...’</p><p>
‘It may...,’ said Tweedledee,</p><p>
‘Contrariwise.’</p><p>
‘How selfish you are!’ thought
Alice, and she was going to say
‘Good-night’ and leave them, when
Tweedledum suddenly asked her, ‘Do
you see that?’ he pointed with his
finger at a small white thing that was
lying under the tree.</p><p>
‘It’s only a rattle, an old rattle...
very old and broken.’</p><p>
‘I knew it!’ cried Tweedledum and
he looked at Tweedledee, who tried
to hide himself under the umbrella.</p><p>
‘You shouldn’t be so angry about
an old rattle,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘But it isn’t old!’ Tweedledum
cried. ‘It’s new... I bought it yesterday...
 my nice new rattle! Do you
agree to have a battle?’ Tweedledum
asked Tweedledee.</p><p>
		‘Yes,’ he answered: ‘only she must
help to dress us.’</p><p>
So the two brothers went into
the wood, and returned in a minute
with lots of things... such
as bolsters, blankets, hearthrugs,
tablecloths, dish-covers and
coal-scuttles. ‘I hope you can help
us with all that,’ Tweedledum said.</p><p>
‘Everything must be on us.’
Alice started to help them, but
they looked so funny in all those
things that Alice laughed very loudly:
but she turned it into a cough,
because she didn’t want to hurt their
feelings.</p><p>
‘Do I look very pale?’ said
Tweedledum, he put his helmet on.
He called it a helmet, although it was
a saucepan.</p><p>
‘Well... yes... a little’, Alice said.</p><p>
‘I’m very brave,’ he said: ‘but today
I have a headache.’</p><p>
‘And I have a toothache now!’</p><p>
said Tweedledee. ‘I’m feeling worse
than you!’</p><p>
‘Then don’t fight today!’ said
Alice.</p><p>
		‘We must fight, but what’s the
time now?’ said Tweedledum.</p><p>
Tweedledee looked at his watch,
and said, ‘Half-past four.’</p><p>
‘Let’s fight till six, and then have
dinner,’ said Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘Very well,’ the other said, ‘and
she can watch us... only don’t come
very close,’ he added: ‘I hit everything
I can see...’</p><p>
‘And I hit everything,’ cried
Tweedledum, ‘whether I can see it or
not!’</p><p>
Alice laughed. ‘You hit the trees
very often, I think,’ she said.</p><p>
‘But this all about a rattle!’ she
added, she hoped to make them
ashamed that they wanted to fight
for such a trifle.</p><p>
‘It was a new rattle!’ cried
Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘I wish the monstrous crow would
come!’ thought Alice.</p><p>
‘We must begin. It’s getting
dark,’ said Tweedledum.</p><p>
‘And darker,’ said Tweedledee.
It was getting dark so suddenly
that Alice thought it was a thunderstorm.</p><p>
‘What a thick black cloud it is!’
she said. ‘And how fast it comes!’</p><p>
‘It’s the crow!’ cried Tweedledum.
And the two brothers ran away quickly. 
Alice ran into the wood, and
stopped under a large tree.</p><p>
‘It can never get at me here,’ she
thought: ‘it’s too large to fly among
the trees. It makes a hurricane in
the wood... oh, here’s somebody’s
scarf!’</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 5.</span> Wool and Water</h3>
<div>

<p>		She caught the scarf, and looked
around, where is the owner? In another
moment the White Queen came
running through the wood, and Alice
went out to meet her with the scarf.</p><p>
‘I’m very glad I’ve met you
here,’ Alice said, she helped the
White Queen to put her scarf on
again.</p><p>
The White Queen only looked at
her, and kept repeating something in
a whisper that sounded like ‘breadand-
butter, bread-and-butter’.</p><p>
Alice saw that the Queen was very
untidy.</p><p>
‘What has happened to you hair?’
asked Alice.</p><p>
‘The brush has got entangled in
it!’ the Queen said. ‘And I lost my
comb yesterday.’</p><p>
Alice did her best to get the hair
into order. ‘You look better now!’ she
said. ‘But really you should have a
maid!’</p><p>
		‘I’ll take you with pleasure!’ the
Queen said. ‘Twopence a week, and
jam every other day.’</p><p>
Alice laughed, as she said, ‘I
don’t want to be your maid... and I
don’t care for jam.’</p><p>
‘It’s very good jam,’ said the
Queen.</p><p>
‘Well, I don’t want any today,
anyway.’</p><p>
‘No,’ the Queen said. ‘The rule is,
jam tomorrow and jam yesterday...
but never jam today.’</p><p>
‘It can be sometimes “jam today”,’
Alice said.</p><p>
‘No, it can’t,’ said the Queen.
‘It’s jam every other day.’</p><p>
‘I don’t understand you,’ said
Alice.</p><p>
‘That’s the effect of living backwards,’
the Queen said kindly.</p><p>
‘Living backwards!’ Alice repeated
in great surprise. ‘I have never
heard about it!’</p><p>
‘Memory works both ways then.’</p><p>
‘I think my memory works only
one way.’ Alice said. ‘I can’t remember
things before they happen.’</p><p>
‘It’s a bad memory that works
only backwards,’ the Queen said.</p><p>
‘What sort of things do you remember
best?’ Alice asked.</p><p>
‘Oh, things that happened the
next week,’ the Queen said. ‘For
instance, now there’s the King’s 
Messenger. He’s in prison now,
he is punished: and the trial won’t
begin till next Wednesday: and
of course there hasn’t been any
crime yet.’</p><p>
		‘Perhaps he will never commit
the crime?’ said Alice.
‘That would be better, wouldn’t
it?’ the Queen said.</p><p>
Alice felt that it was true. ‘Of
course it would be better,’ she said:</p><p>
‘but he is already in prison and he
hasn’t committed the crime yet.’</p><p>
‘You’re wrong,’ said the Queen:</p><p>
‘were you ever punished?’</p><p>
‘Only for faults,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘That makes the difference.’</p><p>
‘But if you hadn’t done them,’ the
Queen said, ‘that would be better;
better, and better, and better!’ Her
voice went higher with each ‘better,’
till it got to a squeak at last.
The Queen began screaming very
loudly, ‘Oh, oh, oh!’ shouted the
Queen, shaking her hand. ‘My finger’s
bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!’</p><p>
‘What’s the matter?’ Alice asked,
‘Have you pricked your finger?’</p><p>
		‘I haven’t pricked it yet,’ the
Queen said, ‘but I will soon... oh, oh,
oh!’</p><p>
‘When are you going to do it?’
Alice was puzzled.</p><p>
‘When I touch my scarf again,’
the poor Queen said: ‘the brooch will
prick me. Oh, oh!’ As she said these
words the brooch opened.</p><p>
‘Be careful!’ cried Alice. But it
was too late. The Queen had pricked
her finger.</p><p>
‘Now you understand the way
things happen here,’ she said to
Alice with a smile.</p><p>
‘But why don’t you scream now?’
Alice asked.</p><p>
‘I’ve screamed already,’ said the
Queen.</p><p>
By this time it was getting light.</p><p>
‘The crow has flown away, I think,’
said Alice: ‘I’m so glad it’s gone!’</p><p>
‘I wish I could be glad too!’ the
Queen said. ‘There is a rule. You
must be happy when you live in this
wood, and be always glad!’</p><p>
‘Only it is so lonely here!’ Alice
said, and two large tears came rolling
down her cheeks.</p><p>
‘Oh, don’t cry!’ cried the poor
Queen. ‘Think about what a good
girl you are. Think about what a long
way you’ve come today. Think about
what o’clock it is. Think about anything,
only don’t cry!’</p><p>
		Alice laughed, ‘Does it help you
not to cry?’ she asked.</p><p>
‘Listen,’ the Queen said: ‘nobody
can do two things at once. Let’s
think about something... how old
are you?’</p><p>
‘I‘m seven and a half.’</p><p>
‘And I’m one hundred and one,
five months and a day,’ the Queen
said.</p><p>
‘I can’t believe that!’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Can’t you?’ the Queen asked.</p><p>
‘Try again: breathe and shut your
eyes.’</p><p>
Alice laughed. ‘You see,’ she said:</p><p>
‘I can’t believe impossible things.’</p><p>
‘You haven’t had much practice,’
said the Queen. ‘When I was your
age, I always did it for half-an-hour
a day. Sometimes I’ve believed about
six impossible things before breakfast.
Oh, the scarf again!’</p><p>
The brooch opened again, and a
sudden wind blew the Queen’s scarf
across a little brook. The Queen
jumped over it and caught it. ‘I’ve
got!’ she cried.</p><p>
‘I hope your finger is better now,’
Alice said very politely, and crossed
the little brook after the Queen.</p><p>
‘Oh, much better!’ cried the
Queen, her voice rose to a squeak
as she went on. ‘Much be-etter! Beetter!
Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!’.</p><p>
Alice looked at the Queen, then
she rubbed her eyes, and looked again.
 She couldn’t understand what
had happened. Was she in a shop?
And was that really... was it really a
sheep that was sitting here? She was
in a little dark shop, and there was an
old Sheep, who was sitting in an armchair
and knitting.</p><p>
		‘What do you want to buy?’ the
Sheep asked.</p><p>
‘I don’t know yet,’ Alice said,
very politely. ‘I would like to look all
round me first.’</p><p>
‘You can look in front of you, and
on both sides,’ said the Sheep: ‘but
you can’t look all round you... you
don’t have eyes at the back of your
head.’</p><p>
Alice looked at the shelves and
came to them.</p><p>
The shop was full of curious
things... but something was very
strange about this shop. Every time
she looked at any shelf, that shelf
was always empty, but the others
were full.</p><p>
Alice was puzzled a lot and looked
at the Sheep. She was now working
with fourteen pairs of needles at
once, and Alice was very much surprised.
‘How can she knit with so many?’
Alice thought to herself. ‘She gets
more and more!’</p><p>
‘Can you row?’ the Sheep asked
and gave Alice a pair of knitting-needles.
		‘Yes, a little... but not on land...
and not with needles...’ Alice said,
when suddenly the needles turned
into oars in her hands, and she understood
that they were in a little
boat. So Alice had to row.
‘The water is very strange too’,
she thought, because every time the
oars got in it they would hardly come
out again.</p><p>
‘Feather! Feather!’ the Sheep
cried. ‘And you will catch a crab.’</p><p>
‘A dear little crab!’ thought Alice.</p><p>
‘I would like to catch it!’</p><p>
‘Didn’t you hear me? I say
“Feather”!’ the Sheep cried angrily
and took more needles.</p><p>
‘I did,’ said Alice: ‘you’ve said
it very loudly. But where are the
crabs?’</p><p>
‘In the water, of course!’ said the
Sheep. ‘Feather, I say!’</p><p>
‘Why do you say “feather” so often?’
Alice asked at last. ’I’m not a
bird!’</p><p>
‘You are,’ said the Sheep: ‘you’re
a little goose.’</p><p>
It offended Alice a little, so they
didn’t talk to each other for a minute
or two. The boat went gently on.</p><p>
‘Oh! There are some water-lilies!’
Alice cried. ‘They are so beautiful!</p><p>
		Please, may we wait and pick some?’
Alice asked. ‘If you don’t mind.’
Alice stopped rowing, the boat
stopped. So Alice forgot all about the
Sheep and the knitting, she tried to
get the most beautiful water-lilies.</p><p>
‘I hope the boat won’t turn over!’
she said to herself. ‘Oh, what a lovely
water-lily! Only I can’t reach it.’</p><p>
‘The prettiest are always further!’
she said at last when she sat
back in the boat.</p><p>
But the next moment the water-
lilies began to fade and lose
all their beauty. Real water-lilies
last very little... and these were
dream-water-lilies, which faded
even faster... but Alice didn’t notice
it, there were so many other curious
things to think about.</p><p>
Suddenly one of the oars got in
the water and didn’t come out again,
and Alice fell down among the water-
lilies.</p><p>
However, she wasn’t hurt, and
was soon up again. The Sheep went
on knitting, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>
‘That was a nice crab!’ the Sheep
said.</p><p>
‘Where? I didn’t see it,’ said
Alice, looking over the side of the
boat into the dark water. ‘I wish I
took one crab home with me!’ But the
Sheep only laughed and went on with
her knitting.</p><p>
		‘Are there many crabs here?’ said
Alice.</p><p>
‘Crabs, and all sorts of things,’
said the Sheep: ‘plenty of choice,
only make up your mind. Now,
what do you want to buy?’</p><p>
‘To buy?’ Alice repeated. The
oars, and the boat, and the river, had
vanished in a moment, and she was
back again in the little dark shop.</p><p>
‘I should like to buy an egg,
please,’ she said. ‘How much?’</p><p>
‘Fivepence for one... Twopence
for two,’ the Sheep said.</p><p>
‘Then two are cheaper than one?’
Alice said in a surprised tone.</p><p>
‘Only you must eat them both, if
you buy two,’ said the Sheep.</p><p>
‘Then I’ll have one, please,’
said Alice and put the money on the
counter.</p><p>
The Sheep took the money. Then
she said ‘I never put things into people’s
hands... you must get it for
yourself.’ And she took the egg and
put it on a shelf.</p><p>
Alice started her way among the
tables and chairs, it was very dark in
the shop.</p><p>
‘Let me see, is this a chair? Oh,
it’s got branches! There are trees!
And there is a little brook! Well,
this is the strangest shop I have ever
seen!’ So she went on, wondering more
and more at every step. Everything turned 
into a tree when she came up
to the egg.</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>Chapter 6.</span> Humpty-Dumpty</h3>
<div>

<p>		However, the egg only became
larger and larger, and looked more
and more human. When she had
come to it, she saw that it had
eyes and a nose and mouth. It was
Humpty Dumpty himself. ‘It can’t
be anybody else!’ she said to herself.
‘I’m sure of it!’</p><p>
Humpty Dumpty was sitting
on the top of a high wall. It was so
narrow that Alice wondered how he
could keep his balance. He didn’t
move and didn’t look at Alice.</p><p>
‘He looks exactly like an egg!’
she said aloud.</p><p>
‘It’s very unpleasant,’ Humpty
Dumpty said after a long silence,
looking away from Alice, ‘when
someone calls an egg!’</p><p>
‘I said you looked like an egg,
Sir,’ Alice gently explained. ‘And
some eggs are very pretty,’ she added.</p><p>
‘Some people,’ said Humpty
Dumpty, looking away from her as
usual, ‘have no more sense than a
baby!’</p><p>
Alice didn’t know what to say to
this: it wasn’t like a conversation.
So she stood and repeated to herself:</p><p> </p><p>

	
			
		Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:</p><p>
		Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.</p><p>
		All the King’s horses and all the King’s men</p><p>
		Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.</p><p> </p><p>




		‘That last line is too long for the
poetry,’ she added. She forgot that
Humpty Dumpty could hear her.</p><p>
‘Don’t stand there talking to
yourself like that,’ Humpty Dumpty
said and looked at her for the first
time, ‘tell me your name.’</p><p>
‘My name is Alice...’</p><p>
‘What a stupid name!’ Humpty
Dumpty interrupted. ‘What does it
mean?’</p><p>
‘Must a name mean something?’
Alice asked.</p><p>
‘Of course it must,’ Humpty
Dumpty said with a short laugh:</p><p>
‘my name means the shape I am...
and it’s a good handsome shape.
With a name like yours, you can be
any shape.’ ‘Why do you sit here alone?’
asked Alice. She didn’t want to begin
an argument.</p><p>
‘Because there’s nobody with
me!’ said Humpty Dumpty. ‘Did
you think I didn’t know the answer
to that? Ask another.’</p><p>
‘Don’t you think you’d be safer
down on the ground?’ Alice went on,
‘This wall is so narrow!’</p><p>
‘What easy questions you ask!’
Humpty Dumpty said. ‘Of course I
don’t think so! If I fell off, the King
has promised me to...’</p><p>
‘To send all his horses and all his
men,’ Alice interrupted.</p><p>
‘That’s too bad!’ Humpty Dumpty
cried. ‘You’ve been listening at
doors... and behind trees... and
down chimneys... you can’t know it!’</p><p>
‘I haven’t!’ Alice said very gently.</p><p>
‘It’s in a book.’</p><p>
‘Oh, well! They may write such
things in a book,’ Humpty Dumpty
said. ‘That’s what you call a History
of England. Now, take a good look
at me! I’m one that has spoken to a
King. May be you’ll never see such
another. See, I’m not even proud,
you may shake hands with me!’ And
he grinned almost from ear to ear
and gave Alice his hand.</p><p>
		‘Yes, all his horses and all his
men,’ Humpty Dumpty went on.</p><p>
‘They’d pick me up again in a minute!
However, this conversation is going
 on too fast: let’s go back to the
last question.’</p><p>
‘I’m afraid I can’t remember it,’
Alice said, very politely.</p><p>
‘In that case we start again,’ said
Humpty Dumpty, ‘and it’s my turn
to ask questions... How old did you
say you were?’</p><p>
Alice said: ‘Seven years and six
months.’</p><p>
‘Seven years and six months!’
Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
‘An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now if you’d asked me, I’d advise
you to stay at seven... but it’s too
late now.’</p><p>
‘I never ask advice about growing,’
Alice said.</p><p>
‘Too proud?’ he asked.</p><p>
‘What a beautiful belt you’ve
got on!’ Alice changed the subject,
‘or... a beautiful cravat... no, a belt,
I mean. I beg your pardon!’ she was
very much puzzled. ‘If only I knew,’
she thought to herself, ‘which was
neck and which was waist!’</p><p>
Humpty Dumpty was very angry
and said nothing for a minute or two.</p><p>
‘It is terrible,’ he said at last,
‘when a person doesn’t know how a
cravat looks like! It’s a cravat, child,
and a beautiful one. It’s a present
from the White King and Queen!’</p><p>
‘Is it really?’ said Alice, she was
pleased to find a good subject at last.</p><p>
		‘They gave it to me,’ Humpty
Dumpty went on, ‘for... an un-birthday
present.’</p><p>
‘But what is an un-birthday present?’
‘When somebody gives you a
present and it isn’t your birthday, of
course.’</p><p>
Alice looked at him thoughtfully.
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she
said.</p><p>
‘You don’t know what you’re
talking about!’ cried Humpty
Dumpty. ‘How many days are there
in a year?’</p><p>
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’
said Alice.</p><p>
‘And how many birthdays have
you?’</p><p>
‘One.’</p><p>
‘And if you take one from three
hundred and sixty-five?’</p><p>
‘Three hundred and sixty-four, of
course.’</p><p>
‘No... I’d like to see it on paper,’
he said.</p><p>
Alice smiled, took out her notebook
and wrote:</p><p>
</p><p>
		</p><p> </p><p>
		 –  = 	
		</p><p> </p><p>

		Humpty Dumpty took the book
and looked at it carefully. ‘Yes, I
think that’s right...’ he began.
‘You’re holding it upside down!’
Alice interrupted. ‘I was sure of that!’ Humpty
Dumpty said when Alice turned it
round for him. ‘I thought it looked
strange... So it shows that there are
three hundred and sixty-four days
when you may get un-birthday presents
...’</p><p>
‘Certainly,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘And only one for birthday presents,
you know. There’s glory for
you!’</p><p>
‘What do you mean by “glory”?’
Alice asked.</p><p>
Humpty Dumpty smiled. ‘I’ll tell
you. I meant “there’s a nice argument
for you!”’</p><p>
‘But “glory” doesn’t mean “a nice
argument”,’ Alice said.</p><p>
‘When I use a word,’ Humpty
Dumpty said, ‘it means just what I
choose it to mean.’</p><p>
‘The question is,’ said Alice,
‘whether you can make words mean
so many different things.’</p><p>
‘The question is,’ said Humpty
Dumpty, ‘which is to be master...
that’s all.’</p><p>
Alice was too much puzzled to say
anything. After a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again. ‘They’ve a
temper, some of them... especially
verbs: they’re the proudest... adjectives...
you can do anything with
them, but not verbs... however, I
can do anything I want with them!
Impenetrability!’</p><p>
		‘Would you tell me please,’ said
Alice, ‘what that means?’</p><p>
‘Now you talk like a clever child,’
said Humpty Dumpty. ‘I meant by
“impenetrability” that we’ve had
enough of that subject, and it would
be nice if you’d say what you are going
to do next. I think you don’t
want to stop here all the rest of your
life.’</p><p>
‘That’s great when one word
means a lot,’ Alice said in a thoughtful
tone. ‘You are very good at
explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Would you tell me the meaning
of the poem, which is called
“Jabberwocky”?’</p><p>
‘Let’s hear it,’ said Humpty
Dumpty. ‘I can explain all the poems!’
Alice repeated the first verse:</p><p> </p><p>

	
		‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p><p>
		Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p><p>
		All mimsy were the borogoves,</p><p>
		And the mome raths outgrabe.’</p><p> </p><p>
	
		‘That’s enough to begin with,’
Humpty Dumpty interrupted:</p><p>
‘there are a lot of hard words there.
“Brillig” means four o’clock in the
afternoon... the time when you begin
broiling things for dinner.’ </p><p>
‘That’ll do very well,’ said
Alice: ‘and “slithy”?’</p><p>
‘Well, “slithy” means “lithe and
slimy”. “Lithe” is the same as “active”.
You see it’s like a portmanteau...
there are two meanings
packed into one word.’</p><p>
‘I see it now,’ Alice said thoughtfully:
‘and what are “toves”?’</p><p>
‘Well, “toves” are something like
badgers... they’re something like lizards....’
‘They are very curious creatures.’</p><p>
‘Yes, they are,’ said Humpty
Dumpty; ‘also they make their nests
under sun-dials ... and they eat
cheese.’</p><p>
‘And what’s about “gyre” and to
“gimble”?’</p><p>
‘To “gyre” is to go round and
round like a gyroscope. To “gimble”
is to make holes like a gimlet.’</p><p>
‘And “the wabe” is the lawn round
a sun-dial?’ said Alice, she finally
understood something.</p><p>
‘Of course, it is. It’s called “wabe”
you know, because it goes a long way
before it, and a long way behind it ...’</p><p>
‘And a long way beyond it on each
side,’ Alice added.</p><p>
		‘Exactly so. Well then, “mimsy”
is “flimsy and miserable” (there’s
another portmanteau for you). And
a “borogove” is a thin bird, which
looks very shabby.’</p><p>
‘And then “mome raths”?’ said
Alice.</p><p>
‘Well, a “rath” is a sort of green
pig, but “mome” I’m not sure about
it...</p><p>
‘And what does “outgrabe”
mean?’</p><p>
‘Well, “outgribing” is something
between bellowing and whistling,
with a kind of sneeze in the middle.
Where did you find this hard poem?’</p><p>
‘I read it in a book,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Tweedledee told me one, which was
much easier.’</p><p>
‘As to poetry, you know,’ said
Humpty Dumpty, ‘I can repeat poetry
too...’</p><p>
‘Oh, you don’t have to!’ Alice
quickly said, hoping to keep him
from beginning.</p><p>
‘The piece that I’m going to repeat,’
he didn’t notice her words,
‘was written for you.’</p><p>
Alice sat down and said sadly:
‘Thank you’.</p><p> </p><p>

	
			
		‘In winter, when the fields are white,</p><p>
		I sing this song for your delight...</p><p>
		only I don’t sing it,’ he added.</p><p> </p><p>

		‘In spring, when woods are getting green,</p><p>
		I’ll try and tell you what I mean...’</p><p> </p><p>

		‘Thank you very much,’ said Alice.</p><p> </p><p>
		
		‘In summer, when the days are long,</p><p> 
		Perhaps you’ll understand the song:</p><p> 
		In autumn, when the leaves are brown,</p><p> 
		Take pen and ink, and write it down.’</p><p> </p><p>

		

		‘I will, if I can remember it,’ said
Alice.</p><p>
‘Stop making remarks like that,’
Humpty Dumpty said: ‘they’re not
sensible, and they put me out.’</p><p> </p><p>



		‘I sent a message to the fish:</p><p>
		I told them “This is what I wish.”</p><p>
		The little fishes of the sea,</p><p>
		They sent an answer back to me.</p><p>
		The little fishes’ answer was</p><p>
		“We cannot do it, Sir, because...”’</p><p> </p><p>

	

		‘I’m afraid I don’t understand,’
said Alice.</p><p>
‘It will be easier,’ Humpty
Dumpty replied.</p><p> </p><p>

	
		
		‘I sent to them again to say</p><p>
		“It will be better to obey.”</p><p>
		The fishes answered, with a grin,</p><p>
		“Why, what a temper you are in!”</p><p>
		I told them once, I told them twice:</p><p>
		They would not listen to advice.</p><p>
		I took a kettle large and new,</p><p>
		Fit for the deed I had to do.</p><p>
		My heart went hop, my heart went thump:</p><p>
		I filled the kettle at the pump.</p><p>
		Then some one came to me and said</p><p>
		“The little fishes are in bed.”</p><p>
		I said to him, I said it plain,</p><p>
		“Then you must wake them up again.”</p><p>
		I said it very loud and clear:</p><p>
		I went and shouted in his ear.’</p><p> </p><p>

	

		Humpty Dumpty raised his voice
almost to a scream as he repeated
this:</p><p> </p><p>
		
		
			
		‘But he was very stiff and proud:</p><p>
		He said, “You needn’t shout so loud!”</p><p>
		And he was very proud and stiff:</p><p>
		He said “I’d go and wake them, if...”</p><p>
		I took a corkscrew from the shelf:</p><p>
		I went to wake them up myself.</p><p>
		And when I found the door was locked,</p><p>
		I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.</p><p>
		And when I found the door was shut,</p><p>
		I tried to turn the handle, but...’</p><p> </p><p>
	

		There was a long pause.
‘Is that all?’ Alice asked.
‘That’s all,’ said Humpty
Dumpty. ‘Good-bye.’
It was very sudden, Alice thought:
but she understood the hint that she
should go. So she got up, gave him
her hand. ‘Good-bye, till we meet
again!’ she said cheerfully.
Humpty Dumpty gave her one of
his fingers to shake and said: ‘You’re
exactly like other people.’</p><p>
‘You should look at my face, people
have different faces,’ Alice said
in a thoughtful tone.</p><p>
‘That’s a problem,’ said Humpty
Dumpty. ‘Your face is the same as everybody
has... the two eyes, nose in
the middle, mouth under. It’s always
the same. Now if you had the two
eyes on the same side of the nose, for
example... or the mouth at the top...
it would help.’</p><p>
‘It wouldn’t look nice,’ Alice
said. But Humpty Dumpty only shut
his eyes.</p><p>
Alice waited a minute but he
didn’t say anything. She said ‘Goodbye!’
once more and quietly went
away. And as she went, she said to herself:</p><p>
 ‘Of all the unsatisfactory
people I ever met...’ She didn’t finish
the sentence, because at this moment
she heard a terrible noise.</p><p> </p>
</div>

		<h3><span>Chapter 7.</span> The Lion and the Unicorn</h3>
<div>

<p>		The next moment soldiers came
running through the wood. Soon
they filled the whole forest. Alice hid
behind a tree and watched them.
She thought that in all her life
she had never seen soldiers so uncertain
on their feet: whenever one
went down, several more always fell
over him, so that the ground was
soon covered with soldiers.
Then came the horses. They had
four feet, but however they fell too.
And Alice was very glad when she
got out of the wood. There she found
the White King. He was sitting on
the ground and writing something in
his note-book.</p><p>
‘I’ve sent them all!’ the King
cried when he saw Alice. ‘Did you
meet any soldiers, my dear, when you
came through the wood?’</p><p>
‘Yes, I did,’ said Alice: ‘several
thousand, I think.’</p><p>
‘Four thousand two hundred and
seven, that’s the exact number,’ 
the King said. ‘I couldn’t send all
the horses, because two of them are
in the game. And I haven’t sent the
two Messengers. They’re both in the
town. Just look and tell me if you can
see them.’</p><p>
‘I see nobody on the road,’ said
Alice.</p><p>
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the
King said. ‘To see Nobody! And at
that distance!’
Alice was still looking along the
road. ‘I see somebody now!’ she said
at last. ‘But he’s coming very slowly...
and how funny he goes!’ (The
messenger was wriggling like an
eel, as he came along, he raised his
great hands like fans on each side.)</p><p>
‘Not at all,’ said the King.</p><p>
‘He only does it when he’s happy.
His name is Haigha. The other
Messenger’s name is Hatta. I must
have two... to come and go. One to
come, and one to go.’</p><p>
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.
‘You don’t have to beg it,’ said
the King.</p><p>
‘I meant that I didn’t understand,’
said Alice. ‘Why one to come
and one to go?’</p><p>
		‘Don’t I tell you?’ the King repeated.
‘I must have two...’</p><p>
At this moment the Messenger
arrived: he was out of breath and 
couldn’t say a word. He could only
wave his hands and make the fearful
faces at the poor King.</p><p>
‘You frighten me!’ said the King.</p><p>
‘I feel bad... Give me a ham sandwich!’
Alice was very much amused, because
the Messenger opened a bag
and handed a sandwich to the King.
And he ate it greedily.</p><p>
‘Another sandwich!’ said the
King.</p><p>
‘I have only hay...,’ the
Messenger said, looking into the bag.</p><p>
‘Hay, then,’ the King said.</p><p>
‘There’s nothing like eating hay
when you’re feeling bad,’ he said to
Alice.</p><p>
‘Who did you meet on the road?’
the King went on.</p><p>
‘Nobody,’ said the Messenger.
‘Quite right,’ said the King: ‘this
young lady saw him too. So Nobody
walks slower than you.’</p><p>
‘I do my best,’ the Messenger
said. ‘I’m sure nobody walks much
faster than I do!’</p><p>
‘He can’t do that,’ said the King,
‘However, now you can tell us what
has happened in the town.’</p><p>
‘I’ll whisper it,’ said the
Messenger. He got close to the King’s
ear. Alice was sorry for this, because 
she wanted to hear the news too.
However, instead of whispering, he
shouted: ‘They’re doing it again!’</p><p>
‘Who are doing it again?’ she
asked.</p><p>
‘The Lion and the Unicorn, of
course,’ said the King.</p><p> 
‘Fighting for the crown?’</p><p> 
‘Yes,’ said the King: ‘and the joke
is, that it’s my crown! Let’s run and
watch them.’</p><p> 
And they ran, Alice repeated to
herself, as she ran, the words of the
old song:
</p><p> </p><p>
		

		‘The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown</p><p>
		The Lion beat the Unicorn all around the town.</p><p>
		Some gave them white bread, and some gave them brown;</p><p>
		Some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town.’</p><p> </p><p>

		

		‘Does... the one... that wins... get
the crown?’ she asked, as she started
to get out of breath. </p><p>
‘Dear me, no!’ said the King.</p><p>
‘What an idea!’</p><p>
Alice had no breath for talking
so they were running in silence, till
they came to a great crowd. In the
middle of that crowd the Lion and
Unicorn were fighting. They were
in a cloud of dust, and at first Alice
could not understand who was who:
but she soon saw the Unicorn with
his horn.</p><p>
They stood near Hatta, the other
messenger. He had a cup of tea in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter
in the other.</p><p>
‘He’s only just out of prison,’
Haigha whispered to Alice: ‘and they
only give them oyster-shells there...
so you see that he’s very hungry
and thirsty. How are you?’ he asked
Hatta.</p><p>
Hatta looked round and nodded,
and went on eating his bread and
butter.</p><p>
‘Were you happy in prison, dear
child?’ said Haigha.
Hatta looked round once more,
and this time a tear or two came rolling
down his cheek: but he didn’t say
a word.</p><p>
‘Speak!’ Haigha cried. But Hatta
only drank some more tea.
‘Speak!’ cried the King. ‘Who is
winning?’</p><p>
Hatta swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. ‘Well,’ he said: </p><p>
‘each of them has fallen down about
eighty-seven times.’</p><p>
‘Then I think they’ll soon bring
the white bread and the brown?’
Alice asked.</p><p>
		‘Yes,’ said Hatta: ‘I’m eating a
bit of it.’</p><p>
There was a pause in the fight, and
the Lion and the Unicorn sat down,
panting. The King cried: ‘Ten minutes
for refreshments!’ Haigha and
Hatta started working, they carried
white and brown bread. Alice took a
piece to taste, but it was very dry.</p><p>
‘I don’t think they’ll fight any
more today,’ the King said to Hatta:</p><p>
‘go and order the drums to begin.’
And Hatta ran away.</p><p>
For a minute or two Alice stood
silent, watching him. Suddenly she
cried, ‘Look, look! It’s the White
Queen! She is running across the
country! How fast those Queens can
run!’</p><p>
‘There’s some enemy after her,
I think,’ the King said and didn’t
even look round. ‘That wood is full
of them.’</p><p>
‘But aren’t you going to run and
help her?’ Alice asked, she was very
much surprised that the King didn’t
worry about the Queen.</p><p>
‘Oh, no use!’ said the King. ‘She
runs very quickly. But I’ll make a 
note about her, if you like... She’s a
good creature,’ he said.</p><p>
At this moment the Unicorn
walked by them, with his hands in his
pockets. ‘I was the best this time?’
he said to the King.</p><p>
‘A little... a little,’ the King said
nervously. ‘But why did you pierce
him with your horn?’</p><p>
‘I didn’t hurt him,’ the Unicorn
said, and he was going to leave, when
suddenly he saw Alice.</p><p>
‘What... is... this?’ he said at
last.</p><p>
‘This is a child!’ Haigha said and
came to Alice. ‘We only found it today!’</p><p>
‘I always thought they were fantastic
monsters!’ said the Unicorn.</p><p>
‘Is it alive?’</p><p>
‘It can talk!’ said Haigha.</p><p>
The Unicorn looked thoughtfully
at Alice, and said: ‘Talk, child.’
Alice smiled and said: ‘Do you
know, I always thought Unicorns
were fantastic monsters, too! I never
saw one alive before!’</p><p>
‘Well, now that we have seen each
other,’ said the Unicorn, ‘if you’ll
believe in me, I’ll believe in you. Do
you agree?’</p><p>
‘Yes, if you like,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Come and give me the plum-cake,
old man!’ the Unicorn turned from
her to the King.</p><p>
		‘Certainly... certainly!’ the King
said, and turned to Haigha. ‘Open
the bag!’ he whispered. ‘Quick! Not
that one... that’s full of hay!’
Haigha took a large cake out of
the bag, and gave it to Alice, while
he got out a dish and a knife.
The Lion joined them soon: he
looked very tired and sleepy, and his
eyes were half shut. ‘What’s this!’ he
said, looking at Alice.</p><p>
‘Ah, what is it?’ the Unicorn cried.</p><p>
‘You’ll never guess! I couldn’t.’
The Lion looked at Alice thoughtfully.</p><p>
‘Are you animal... vegetable... or
mineral?’ he said and yawned at every
word.</p><p>
‘It’s a fantastic monster!’ the
Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
say anything.</p><p>
‘Then hand round the plumcake,
Monster,’ the Lion said. He
lay down and put his head on his
paws.</p><p>
‘And sit down, both of you,’ (to
the King and the Unicorn): ‘fair play
with the cake!’</p><p>
The King felt very uncomfortable,
because he sat down between
the two great creatures; but there
was no other place for him.
Alice sat down on the bank of a
little brook, with the great dish on
her knees. She tried to cut the cake.
‘It’s very strange!’ she said, ‘I’ve cut 
several slices already, but they always
join on again!’</p><p>
		‘You don’t know how to cut
Looking-glass cakes,’ the Unicorn
said. ‘Hand it round first, and cut it
afterwards.’</p><p>
It was nonsense, but Alice got up
and carried the dish round, and the
cake divided itself into three pieces
as she did so. ‘Now cut it,’ said the
Lion, when she returned to her place
with the empty dish.</p><p>
‘I say, it isn’t fair!’ cried the
Unicorn. ‘The Monster has given the
Lion twice as much as me!’</p><p>
‘She’s given none for herself,
anyhow,’ said the Lion. ‘Do you like
plum-cake, Monster?’</p><p>
But before Alice could answer
him, the drums began. She couldn’t
understand where the noise came
from. She got up and jumped over
the little brook.</p><p>
She looked back and saw, that the
Lion and the Unicorn rose to their feet
with angry looks that they were interrupted
in their feast. Alice put her
hands over her ears, trying not to hear
the terrible sound of drums.</p><p>
‘If that doesn’t “drum them out
of town,”’ she thought to herself,
‘nothing ever will!’</p>
</div>

		<h3><span>Chapter 8.</span> ‘It’s my own invention!’</h3>
<div>

<p>		After a while the noise disappeared,
and Alice looked around.</p><p>
There was nobody, and her first
thought was that she had a dream
about the Lion and the Unicorn. But
then she saw a dish near her feet.</p><p>
‘So I wasn’t dreaming, after all,’ she
said to herself, ‘or... we’re all part
of the same dream. Only I hope it’s
my dream, and not the Red King’s!
I don’t like to be in another person’s
dream.’</p><p>
At this moment her thoughts
were interrupted by a loud shouting
of ‘Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!’ and a
Knight dressed in red, came galloping
to her. When he reached her, the
horse stopped suddenly: ‘You’re my
prisoner!’ the Knight cried.
But Alice was more frightened
for him than for herself at the moment,
because he fell down from the
horse. When he was again in the saddle,
he began once more ‘You’re my...</p><p>
’ but here another voice cried ‘Ahoy!
Ahoy! Check!’ and Alice looked round
in some surprise.</p><p>
This time it was a White Knight.
He came up to Alice and fell off his
horse just as the Red Knight had
done. Then he got on again, and the
two Knights sat and looked at each
other for some time without speaking. 
Alice looked from one to the other
in some confusion.</p><p>
		‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’
the Red Knight said at last.</p><p>
‘Yes, but then I came and saved
her!’ the White Knight said.</p><p>
‘Well, we must fight for her,
then,’ said the Red Knight and put
his helmet on.</p><p>
‘You will follow the Rules of
Battle, of course?’ the White
Knight said, putting on his helmet
too.</p><p>
‘I always do,’ said the Red Knight,
and they began fighting with such
fury that Alice hid behind a tree.</p><p>
‘I wonder, what the Rules of
Battle are,’ she said to herself, ‘if
one Knight hits the other, he knocks
him off his horse, and if he misses,
he falls off himself... What a noise
they make when they fall! And how
quiet the horses are! They let them
get on and off them as if they were
tables!’</p><p>
Another Rule of Battle was that
they always fell on their heads. The
battle ended when the both fell off
their horses. When they got up,
they shook hands, and then the Red
Knight galloped off.</p><p>
‘It was a victory, wasn’t it?’ said
the White Knight.</p><p>
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.</p><p>
‘I don’t want to be anybody’s
prisoner. I want to be a Queen.’</p><p>
		‘You will be a Queen, when you’ve
crossed the next brook,’ said the
White Knight. ‘I’ll help you to get
to the end of the wood... and then I
must go back. That’s the end of my
move.’</p><p>
‘Thank you very much!’ said
Alice. ‘May I help you with your helmet?’
It was not very easy, but finally
she took it off.</p><p>
‘Now I can breathe more easily,’
said the Knight. He put back his hair
with both hands, and turned his gentle
face and large kind eyes to Alice.
She thought she had never seen
such a strange-looking soldier in all
her life. He was dressed in armour,
which fit him very badly. And he had
a strange little letter-box across his
shoulder, which was upside-down.
Alice looked at it with great curiosity.
‘I see you like my little box,’ the
Knight said in a friendly tone. ‘It’s
my own invention... I keep clothes
and sandwiches here. You see I carry
it upside-down, so that the rain can’t
get in.’</p><p>
‘But the things can fall out,’
Alice said. ‘Do you know that the
lid’s open?’</p><p>
‘I didn’t know that,’ the Knight
said. ‘Then all the things have fallen
out! And the box is useless.’ He
was going to throw it into the bushes,
when a sudden thought came to him, and he hung it carefully on a
tree.</p><p>
		‘Can you guess why I did that?’ he
said to Alice.</p><p>
Alice shook her head.</p><p>
‘I hope some bees can make a nest
in it... then I will get the honey.’</p><p>
‘But you’ve got already a beehive...
or something like it... on your
saddle,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Yes, it’s a very good beehive,’
the Knight said, ‘one of the best! But
there are no bees. And the other thing
is a mouse-trap. I think the mice keep
the bees out... or the bees keep the
mice out, I don’t know.’</p><p>
‘I don’t think there are any mice
on the horse’s back,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘Perhaps,’ said the Knight: ‘but
if they come...You see,’ he went on
after a pause, ‘it’s as well to be provided
for everything. That’s why
the horse has all those bracelets
round its feet.’</p><p>
‘But what are they for?’ Alice asked
in a tone of great curiosity. ‘Against
the bites of sharks,’ the Knight said.</p><p>
‘It’s an invention of my own! What’s
this dish for?’</p><p>
‘For plum-cake,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘We’d better take it with us, the
Knight said. ‘It’ll be usefull if we
find any plum-cake. Help me to put it
into this bag.’</p><p>
It took a very long time to do it.
Alice held the bag very carefully, but 
the Knight was very clumsy: he fell
in the bag himself instead several
times.</p><p>
		‘It’s very difficult, you see,’ he
said, as they put the dish in it at last;
‘There are so many candlesticks in
the bag.’ And he hung it to the saddle,
which was already full of bunches
of carrots and many other things.</p><p>
Alice and the Knight walked
some time in silence. They stopped
very often, and Alice helped the poor
Knight, who was not a good rider.
Every time the horse stopped, he fell
off in front; and every time it went
on again, he fell off behind.</p><p>
‘I’m afraid you haven’t had much
practice in riding,’ she said, when
she was helping him.</p><p>
The Knight looked very much
surprised and a little offended.</p><p>
‘What makes you say that?’ he
asked, as he got back into the saddle.</p><p>
‘Because people don’t fall off
so often, when they’ve had enough
practice.’</p><p>
‘I’ve had a lot of practice,’ the
Knight said: ‘a lot of practice! The
great art of riding,’ the Knight said
in a loud voice, waving his arms as
he spoke, ‘is to keep...’ Here the sentence
ended suddenly, because the
Knight fell on the top of his head
exactly in the path where Alice was walking.
 She was frightened this
time, and asked, ‘I hope no bones are
broken?’</p><p>
		‘None,’ the Knight said. ‘The
great art of riding, as I was saying,
is... to keep your balance! Like
this... ’</p><p>
He wanted to show Alice what he
meant, and this time he fell on his
back, right under the horse’s feet.
‘A lot of practice!’ he went on repeating
all the time when Alice was
getting him on his feet again. ‘A lot
of practice!’</p><p>
‘It’s just funny!’ cried Alice, she
lost all her patience. ‘You should
ride a wooden horse on wheels!’
‘Fine! I’ll get one,’ the Knight
said thoughtfully to himself. ‘One or
two... several.’</p><p>
There was a short silence after
this, and then the Knight went on
again. ‘I’m great at inventing things.
I think you noticed that when you
picked me up last time, I was thoughtful.
Well, just then I was inventing
a new way, how to get over a gate...
Would you like to hear it?’</p><p>
‘Yes, please,’ Alice said politely.</p><p>
‘I’ll tell you!’ said the Knight.</p><p>
‘You see, I said to myself, “The only
difficulty is with the feet: the head
is high already.” Now, first I put my
head on the top of the gate... then I
stand on my head... then the feet are
high, you see... then I’m over!’</p><p>
		‘Yes, I think you’d be over,’ Alice
said thoughtfully: ‘but don’t you
think it would be very difficult?’</p><p>
‘I haven’t tried it yet,’ the
Knight said: ‘so I can’t tell now...
but I’m afraid it would be a little
difficult.’</p><p>
He looked so worried, that Alice
decided to change the subject.
‘What a curious helmet you’ve
got!’ she said cheerfully. ‘Is that
your invention too?’</p><p>
The Knight looked proudly at his
helmet, which hung on the saddle.
‘Yes,’ he said, ‘but I’ve invented a
better one than that... like a sugar
loaf. When I wore it, if I fell off the
horse, it always touched the ground
directly. So I had a very little way to
fall, you see... But there was the danger...
I could fall into it. And it happened
to me once... and the worst
of it was, that before I could get out,
the other White Knight came and
put it on. He thought it was his own
helmet.’</p><p>
Alice tried not to laugh. ‘I’m
afraid you had hurt him,’ she said,
‘because you were on the top of his
head.’</p><p>
‘I had to kick him, of course,’ the
Knight said, very seriously. ‘And
then he took the helmet off again...
but it took hours and hours to get me out.
 I was as fast as... as lightning,
you know.’</p><p>
		He raised his hands in some excitement
as he said this, rolled out of
the saddle, and fell into a hole.
Alice ran up to him, she was
afraid that he was really hurt this
time. At first she could see only his
feet, but then she heard that he kept
on talking in his usual tone. ‘It was
careless of him to put another man’s
helmet on... with the man in it, too.’
‘How can you keep on talking?’
Alice asked, as she helped him to
stand.</p><p>
The Knight looked surprised. ‘My
mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, when I am downwards, I keep
inventing new things.’</p><p>
‘Now the cleverest thing of the
sort that I ever did,’ he went on
after a pause, ‘was inventing a new
pudding.’</p><p>
‘What was it made of?’ Alice
asked.</p><p>
‘Blotting paper,’ the Knight answered.</p><p>
‘It wasn’t very nice, I’m afraid...’
‘Not very nice alone,’ he interrupted:</p><p>
‘but if it would be mixed
with other things... And here I must
leave you.’</p><p>
		They had just come to the end of
the wood.</p><p>
Alice was very much puzzled: she
was thinking of the pudding.</p><p>
‘You are sad,’ the Knight said:</p><p>
‘let me sing you a song!’</p><p>
‘Is it very long?’ Alice asked, she
had heard a lot of poetry that day.</p><p>
‘It’s long,’ said the Knight, ‘but
very, very beautiful. The name of the
song is called “Haddocks Eyes.”’</p><p>
‘Oh, that’s the name of the song,
is it?’ Alice said.</p><p>
‘No, you don’t understand,’ the
Knight said, ‘That’s what the name
is called. The name really is “The
Aged Aged Man.”’</p><p>
‘Then I have to say “That’s what
the song is called”?’ Alice corrected
herself.</p><p>
‘No, that’s quite another thing!
The song is called “Ways and Means”,
but that’s only what it’s called!’</p><p>
‘Well, what is the song, then?’
said Alice, who was completely puzzled.
‘The song really is “A-sitting On
A Gate”, and the tune is my own invention,’
the Knight said.</p><p>
He stopped his horse and with a
weak smile he began singing.</p><p>
Alice saw a lot of strange
things in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, but this was that
she always remembered very clearly.
After many years she could retell 
it, as if it had been only yesterday...
The blue eyes and kind smile
of the Knight... the setting sun that
was shining through his hair... the
horse was quietly moving about...
and the black shadows of the forest
behind... And she listened in a half
dream to the music of the song.</p><p>
		When the Knight sang the last
words of the song, he said. ‘You have
to go only a few yards,’ he said,
‘down the hill and over that little
brook, and then you’ll be a Queen...
But you’ll stay and watch me first,
won’t you?’ he added. ‘It won’t be
long. You’ll wait and wave your
handkerchief when I get to that turn
in the road, won’t you? I think it’ll
encourage me...’</p><p>
‘Of course I’ll wait,’ said Alice:
‘and thank you very much that
you’ve come with me... and thank
you for the song... I liked it very
much!’</p><p>
So they shook hands, and then
the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest. ‘It won’t take long, I think,’
Alice said to herself, she stood and
watched him. ‘There he goes!
Right on his head as usual! However,
he gets on again very easily...’ The
Knight fell off again and again. After
the fourth or fifth fall he reached the
turn. Alice waved her handkerchief
 to him. ‘I hope he’ll be alright,’ she
said and she ran down the hill.</p><p>
‘And now it’s time for the last
brook, and I’ll be a Queen! How great
it sounds!’ She was at the edge of the
brook. ‘The Eighth Square at last!’
she cried when she jumped it over.</p><p>
‘Oh, how glad I am to get here! And
what is on my head?’ she asked. Alice
put her hands up to something very
heavy round her head.</p><p>
‘But how can it be there?’ she
said to herself, and took it off. It was
a golden crown.</p>
</div>

		<h3><span>Chapter 9.</span> Queen Alice</h3>
<div>

<p>		‘Well, this is great!’ said Alice.
‘I never thought I would be a Queen
so soon... and I’ll tell you, your
majesty,’ she said to herself, ‘you
shouldn’t lie on the grass like that!’
So she got up and walked about.
She was afraid that the crown could
fall off.</p><p>
‘But if I am really a Queen...’ she
began.</p><p>
Everything happened so strangely
that she wasn’t even surprised
when she saw the Red Queen and
the White Queen, who were sitting
close to her, one on each side. She
wanted to ask them how they came
there, but then she thought it would
not be polite. However, she thought 
she should ask if the game was over.
‘Please, would you tell me... ’ she began,
looking at the Red Queen.</p><p>
‘Speak when somebody speaks to
you!’ The Queen interrupted her.
‘But if everybody obeyed that
rule,’ said Alice, ‘and if you only
spoke when somebody spoke to you,
and the other person always waited
that you would begin, nobody would
say anything!’</p><p>
‘Don’t you understand, child...
’ cried the Red Queen, but then she
stopped, thought a bit and suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation.
‘What right have you to call
yourself a Queen? You can’t be a
Queen, till you’ve passed the examination.
And the sooner we begin it,
the better. Always speak the truth...
think before you speak... and write it
down!’</p><p>
There was then an uncomfortable
silence for a minute or two. Finally
the Red Queen said to the White
Queen, ‘I invite you to Alice’s dinner-
party this afternoon.’</p><p>
The White Queen smiled and said
‘And I invite you.’</p><p>
‘I didn’t know I have a party at
all,’ said Alice; ‘but if it’s true, I
think I should invite the guests.’</p><p>
‘Now you can do it,’ the Red
Queen said: ‘but I think you haven’t
had many lessons in manners.’</p><p>
		‘Lessons don’t teach you manners,’
said Alice. ‘Lessons teach you
to do sums and so on.’</p><p>
‘And do you know how to do
Addition?’ the White Queen asked.</p><p>
‘What’s one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one
and one and one?’</p><p>
‘I don’t know,’ said Alice. ‘I lost
count.’</p><p>
‘She can’t do Addition,’ the Red
Queen interrupted. ‘Can you do
Subtraction? Takeninefromeight.’</p><p>
‘I can’t,’ Alice said: ‘but... ’</p><p>
‘She can’t do Subtraction,’ said
the White Queen.</p><p>
‘Can you do Division? Divide a
loaf by a knife... what’s the answer?’</p><p>
‘I think... ’ Alice began, but the
Red Queen already answered. ‘Breadand-
butter, of course. Try another
Subtraction sum. Take a bone from a
dog: what remains?’</p><p>
Alice thought a bit. ‘The bone
wouldn’t remain, of course, if I
took it... and the dog wouldn’t remain;
it would run to bite me... and I
wouldn’t remain!’</p><p>
‘Then you think nothing would
remain?’ said the Red Queen.</p><p>
		‘I think that’s the answer.’</p><p>
‘Wrong, as usual,’ said the Red
Queen: ‘the dog’s temper would remain.’</p><p>
‘But I don’t understand...’</p><p>
‘Look here!’ the Red Queen cried.</p><p>
‘The dog would lose its temper,
wouldn’t it?’</p><p>
‘Perhaps it would,’ Alice said.</p><p>
‘Then if the dog went away, its
temper would remain!’ the Queen
cried.</p><p>
‘And if it went away too?’ asked
Alice. But she thought to herself
all the time, ‘What nonsense we are
talking!’</p><p>
‘She can’t do sums at all!’ the
Queens said together.</p><p>
‘Can you do sums?’ Alice said and
turned suddenly to the White Queen.
The Queen shut her eyes. ‘I can do
Addition if you give me time...’</p><p>
‘Of course, you know your ABC?’</p><p>
said the Red Queen.</p><p>
‘I do,’ said Alice.</p><p>
‘So do I,’ the White Queen whispered:
‘we’ll learn it together, dear.</p><p>
And I’ll tell you a secret... I can read
words of one letter! Isn’t that great?
Don’t worry, you’ll learn it some
day!’</p><p>
Here the Red Queen began again.
‘Can you answer useful questions?’
she said. ‘How is bread made?’</p><p>
‘I know that!’ Alice cried. ‘You
take some flour...’</p><p>
		‘Where can you take the flower?’</p><p>
the White Queen asked. ‘In a garden,
or in the hedges?’</p><p>
‘You don’t understand,’ Alice explained:
‘it’s ground... ’</p><p>
‘How many acres of ground?’ said
the White Queen.</p><p>
‘Fan her head!’ the Red Queen
interrupted. ‘She’ll be hot!’ So they
fanned her with leaves, till she had
to ask them to stop.</p><p>
‘She’s all right again,’ said
the Red Queen. ‘Do you know
Languages? What’s the French for
fiddle-de-dee?’</p><p>
‘Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,’
Alice said.</p><p>
‘I didn’t say it,’ said the Red
Queen.</p><p>
‘If you’ll tell me what language
“fiddle-de-dee” is, I’ll tell you the
French for it!’ Alice said.</p><p>
‘Don’t let us quarrel,’ the White
Queen said. ‘What is the cause of
lightning?’</p><p>
‘The cause of lightning...’ Alice
said, ‘is the thunder... no, no!’ she
corrected herself. ‘The other way.’</p><p>
‘It’s too late to correct it,’ said
the Red Queen.</p><p>
‘Oh, we had such a thunderstom
last Tuesday,’ the White Queen said,
she was very nervous, ‘I mean last
Tuesdays.’</p><p>
Alice was puzzled.</p><p>
		‘In our country,’ she said, ‘we
have only one day at a time.’</p><p>
The Red Queen said, ‘Now here,
we have days and nights two or three
at a time, and sometimes in the winter
we have five nights together...
for warmth, you know.’</p><p>
‘It’s like a riddle with no answer!’
Alice thought.</p><p>
Here the White Queen began
again. ‘It was such a thunderstorm,
you can’t imagine! And part of the
roof came off, and thunder got in...
and it went rolling round the room...
and knocking over the tables and
things... I was so frightened, I
couldn’t remember my own name!’
‘Your Majesty must excuse her,’
the Red Queen said to Alice, she took
one of the White Queen’s hand in
her own and gently stroked it: ‘she
is good, but she always says foolish
things.’</p><p>
The White Queen looked at Alice
in a shy way. Alice felt she should say
something kind, but couldn’t think
of anything at the moment.</p><p>
‘It’s amazing how good she is! Pat
her on the head, and see how pleased
she’ll be!’ the Red Queen went on.
Suddenly the White Queen laid
her head on Alice’s shoulder. ‘I am
so sleepy,’ she said.</p><p>
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said
the Red Queen. ‘Give her your nightcap
and sing her a lullaby.’ ‘I haven’t got a nightcap with
me,’ said Alice: ‘and I don’t know
any lullabies.”</p><p>
‘I must do it myself, then,’ said
the Red Queen, and she began:</p><p> 

		
		‘Hush-a-by lady, in Alice’s lap!</p><p>
		Till the feast’s ready, we ve time for a nap.’</p><p>
		When the feast’s over, we’ll go to the ball—</p><p>
		Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!</p><p> </p><p>
		

		‘Now you know the words,’ she
added and put her head down on
Alice’s other shoulder, ‘just sing it.</p><p>
I’m sleepy, too.’ In another moment
both Queens were asleep, and snoring
loud.</p><p>
‘What should I do? said Alice,
‘I don’t think it happened before,
that any one had to take care of
two Queens asleep at once! No... it
couldn’t, you know, because there
was never more than one Queen at a
time. Wake up, you heavy things!’
she went on, but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring. </p><p>
Suddenly the two Queens disappeared,
and Alice saw that she was
standing before the door over which
were the words “QUEEN ALICE” in
large letters, and on each side there
was a bell-handle; one was marked
‘Visitors’ Bell,’ and the other
‘Servants’ Bell.’</p><p>
‘Which bell should I ring?’ she
said. ‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a
servant. There should be one, marked
“Queen”.’</p><p>
Just then the door opened, and
a creature with a long beak put its
head out for a moment and said ‘No
entry till the next week!’ and shut
the door.</p><p>
Alice knocked and rang for a long
time, but at last, a very old Frog, who
was sitting under a tree, got up and
came slowly to her. He was dressed in
bright yellow, and had large boots.
‘What is it?’ the Frog whispered.
Alice turned round. ‘Where’s the
servant who answers the door?’ she
began angrily.</p><p>
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.
‘This door, of course!’ Alice said.
The Frog looked at the door with
his large dull eyes for a minute: then
he went nearer, then he looked at
Alice.</p><p>
‘To answer the door?’ he said.</p><p>
‘Who asks it?’ ‘I don’t know what you mean,’
she said.</p><p>
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog
went on. ‘Or are you deaf? What did
it ask you?’</p><p>
‘Nothing!’ Alice said. ‘I’ve
knocked at it!’</p><p>
‘You shouldn’t do that...’ the
Frog said. Then he went up and
kicked the door with one of his
great feet. ‘Let it alone,’ he said,
‘and it’ll let you alone.’
At this moment the door opened,
and Alice heard a song:</p><p> </p><p>


			
		‘To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,</p><p>
		“I’ve a sceptre in hand, I’ve a crown on my head;</p><p>
		Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,</p><p>
		Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.”’</p><p>
		‘Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,</p><p>
		And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran.’</p><p>
		Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea—</p><p>
		And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!’	</p><p> </p><p>



		Alice thought to herself ‘Thirty
times three makes ninety. Can anybody
 count here? I think I’ll go in.’
There was silence when she appeared.
Alice walked into a large hall
with a table and noticed that there
were about fifty guests. Some were
animals, some birds, and there were
even a few flowers among them. ‘I’m
glad they’ve come without invitation,’
she thought: ‘I didn’t know
who to invite!’</p><p>
There were three chairs at the
head of the table. The Red and White
Queens had already taken two of
them, but the middle chair was
empty. Alice sat down in silence.
At last the Red Queen began.</p><p>
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she
said. ‘Bring the meat!’ And the waiters
brought a leg of mutton. Alice
looked very nervous, because she had
never carved mutton leg before.</p><p>
‘You look shy; let me introduce
you to that leg of mutton,’ said
the Red Queen. ‘Alice — Mutton;
Mutton — Alice.’ The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and bowed to Alice.
And she bowed too, she didn’t know
whether she should be frightened or
amused.</p><p>
‘May I give you a slice?’ Alice
said and took the knife and fork. She
looked from one Queen to the other.</p><p>
‘Certainly not,’ the Red Queen:</p><p>
‘it isn’t polite to cut any one so 
soon after you’ve been introduced.
Remove the mutton leg.’</p><p>
		The waiters removed it and
brought a large plum-pudding.</p><p>
‘I don’t want to be introduced
to the pudding, please,’ Alice said,
‘May I give you some?’</p><p>
But the Red Queen looked angrily
and cried ‘Pudding — Alice; Alice —
Pudding. Remove the pudding!’ and
the waiters took it very quickly.</p><p>
‘The Red Queen is the only one
who gives orders!’ thought Alice
to herself. As an experiment, she
called ‘Waiter! Bring back the pudding!’
and here it was again. It was so
large that she felt really a little shy
with it. However, she cut a slice and
handed it to the Red Queen.</p><p>
‘How rude!’ cried the Pudding.</p><p>
‘I wonder how you’d like it, if I cut
a slice out of you, you creature!’
Alice was so amazed that she
couldn’t say a word: she could only
sit and look at it.</p><p>
‘Say something,’ said the Red
Queen: ‘The pudding speaks and you
don’t!’</p><p>
‘Do you know, I’ve heard a lot
of poetry today...’ Alice began.
Everybody stopped talking and
looked at her. ‘And it’s very curious,
I think... every poem was
about fish. Why do they like fish so
much?’ ‘As for fishes,’ the Red Queen put
her mouth close to Alice’s ear, ‘her
White Majesty knows a nice riddle...
about fish. May she repeat it?’</p><p>
‘Her Red Majesty’s very kind,’
the White Queen said into Alice’s
other ear. ‘It would be great! May
I?’</p><p>
‘Please do,’ Alice said very politely.
The White Queen laughed and
stroked Alice’s cheek. Then she began:</p><p> </p><p>


		
		‘First, the fish must be caught.’</p><p>
		That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.</p><p>
		‘Next, the fish must be bought.’</p><p>
		That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.</p><p> </p><p>

		‘Now cook me the fish! ’</p><p>
		That is easy and will not take more than a minute.</p><p>
		‘Let it lie in a dish!’</p><p>
		That is easy, because it already is in it.</p><p> </p><p>

		‘Bring it here! Let me sup!’</p><p>
		It is easy to set such a dish on the table.</p><p>
		‘Take the dish-cover up!’</p><p>
		Ah, that is so hard that I fear I’m unable!	</p><p> </p><p>

		For it holds it like glue—</p><p>
		Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:</p><p>
		Which is easiest to do,</p><p>
		Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?’</p><p> </p><p>




		‘Take a minute to think about it,
and then guess,’ said the Red Queen.
‘Now we’ll drink your health...
Queen Alice’s health!’ she cried and
all the guests began drinking. Some
of them put their glasses on their
heads and drank all that went down
their faces. Others broke the glasses
and drank the wine from the table.</p><p>
‘Just like pigs!’ thought Alice.</p><p>
‘You should thank them,’ the Red
Queen said, looking at Alice.</p><p>
‘We’ll help you,’ the White Queen
whispered.</p><p>
Alice got up but was a little
frightened.</p><p>
‘Thank you very much,’ she whispered,
‘but I can do it well without
your help.’</p><p>
‘It wouldn’t be the same thing,’
the Red Queen said.</p><p>
‘I rise to thank you...’ Alice began.
And she really rose when she
spoke, several inches. But she caught
the edge of the table, and pull herself
down.</p><p>
‘Take care of yourself!’ cried the
White Queen and caught Alice’s hair 
with both her hands. ‘Something’s
going to happen!’</p><p>
		And then (as Alice afterwards
described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles grew
up to the ceiling. The bottles took a
pair of plates just like wings, and
with forks for legs, ran in all directions.
‘Look like birds,’ Alice thought
to herself.</p><p>
At this moment she heard a
laugh. She turned and saw that instead
of the White Queen, there was
the leg of mutton. It was sitting in
her chair.</p><p>
‘Here I am!’ cried a voice. And
Alice turned again and saw the
White Queen’s kind face in the soup,
she smiled and disappeared.</p><p>
Several guests were lying down in
the dishes, and the soup spoon was
walking towards Alice’s chair.
‘I can’t stand this any longer!’
she cried. She jumped up and took
the table-cloth with both hands. One
good pull, and plates, dishes, guests,
and candles fell down together on the
floor.</p><p>
‘And as for you...’ she turned to
the Red Queen, but the Queen was no
longer in her chair. She turned into
a little doll, and was now running
round and round on the table.</p><p>
Alice wasn’t surprised at all. </p><p>
‘As for you,’ she repeated and
caught the little creature, ‘I’ll punish
you like a kitten!’</p>

		<h3><span>Chapter 10.</span> Shaking</h3>
<div>
<p>		She took her off the table and
shook her up and down.</p><p>
The Red Queen’s face became
very small, and her eyes grew large
and green. Alice kept on shaking,
and the Queen kept on growing fatter,
softer, and rounder... and...</p>
</div>

		<h3><span>Chapter 11.</span> Waking</h3>
<div>

<p>		... and it really was a kitten, after
all.</p>
</div>

		<h3><span>Chapter 12.</span> Which Dreamed it?</h3>
<div>

<p>		‘Your majesty shouldn’t purr so
loud,’ Alice said and rubbed her eyes,
there was Kitty next to her. ‘Oh, you
woke me out of such a nice dream!
And you’ve been with me, Kitty... all
the time through the Looking-Glass
world. Did you know it, dear?’
But Kitty only purred.</p><p>
‘If only kittens would only purr
for “yes” and mew for “no”!’ Alice
said, ‘How can you talk with a person
if he always says the same thing?’
Alice found the Red Queen among
the chessmen on the table. Then she
went down on her knees on the carpet
and put the kitten and the Queen together.</p><p>
‘Now, Kitty!’ Alice cried and
clapped her hands. ‘Say that it was
you!’</p><p>
But Kitty didn’t look at it, it
turned away its head, and pretended
that it didn’t see the chessman. But
however, the kitten looked a little
ashamed of itself.</p><p>
‘Sit up, dear!’ Alice cried with
a laugh. ‘And curtsey while you’re
thinking what to... what to purr.
It saves time, remember?’ And she
caught Kitty and kissed it.</p><p>
‘Snowdrop, my pet!’ she said
and looked at the White Kitten,
which was still patiently undergoing
 its toilet, ‘when will Dinah finish
with your White Majesty, I wonder?
That’s why you were so untidy
in my dream... Dinah! Do you know
that you’re washing a White Queen?
Really!</p><p>
‘And what did Dinah turn to,
I wonder?’ Alice asked, ‘Tell me,
Dinah, did you turn to Humpty
Dumpty? However, I’m not sure...’</p><p>
‘By the way, Kitty, there was one
thing in my dream that you’d like...
The poetry there was all about fish!
Tomorrow morning you’ll have one.
And I’ll repeat “The Walrus and the
Carpenter” to you!</p><p>
‘Now, Kitty, let’s consider whose
dream it was. This is a serious question,
my dear, and you should not go
on licking your paw like that... as if
Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning!
You see, Kitty, it can be me or the
Red King. He was part of my dream,
of course... but then I was part of
his dream, too! Was it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so
you should know... Oh, Kitty, help
me! I’m sure your paw can wait!’
But the kitten only began licking
the other paw, and pretended it
hadn’t heard the question.
Who do you think it was?</p>

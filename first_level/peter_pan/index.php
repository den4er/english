<h2>"Peter and Wendy" <span>James Barrie</span></h2>

<h3><span>CHAPTER 1</span> Peter Pan Games</h3>
<div>


<p>
All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that
All they will grow up, and Wendy knew it too. One day
when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she picked up a flower and ran with it to her
mother. She looked very pretty, and Mrs. Darling put
her hand to her heart and said:
</p><p>
‘Oh, why can’t you be like this forever!’
</p><p>
This was all she said on the subject, but since then Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you
are two. Two is the beginning of the end.
</p><p>
Wendy’s mother was a very beautiful woman. Mr. Darling married her this way: one day many gentlemen who
were her childhood friends discovered that they loved
her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except
Mr. Darling, who took a cab and came to her first, and so he
got her.
</p><p>
Mr. Darling often said to Wendy: ‘Your mother does not
justlove me, she also respects me’. He was one ofthose clever
persons who know all about stocks and shares. Of course
no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know.
</p><p>
Wendy came first, then John and then Michael.
For a week or two after Wendy’s birth, her parents were
thinking over one important question: ‘Can we keep her?’
as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was proud
of her, but he was very reasonable, and he sat on the edge
of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating
expenses, and she looked at him. She wanted to keep her
daughter, but he was not sure and asked her:
</p><p>
‘Will we be able to feed the family?’
</p><p>
‘Of course we will, George,’ she cried. She loved the girl
so much, but he wanted to make sure.
</p><p>
‘Remember children’s illnesses,’ he said.
</p><p>
There was the same situation over John and Michael, but
the parents decided to keep both of them, and soon you
could see the three children going in a line to Miss Fulsom’s
Kindergarten school with their nurse.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling loved to have everything in order, and
Mr. Darling wanted to be exactly like his neighbours; so, of
course, they had a nurse. As they were poor, this nurse was
a Newfoundland dog, called Nana. At first she belonged to no
one. She always loved children, and one day the Darlings
met her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of
her spare time looking after the babies. She hated careless nurses and followed them to their homes to complain
about them. Nana proved to be a perfect nurse. She was very
accurate at bath-time, and she was up at any moment of the
night when any of the children had a bad dream. Of course
her kennel was in the nursery. It was nice to see her escorting the children to the kindergarten, walking by their side
when they behaved well, and slightly pushing them back into
line when they strayed. She usually carried an umbrella in
her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement
 of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat on
forms, and Nana lay on the ﬂoor, but that was the only difference.</p><p>
She was a perfect nurse, and Mr. Darling knew it, but
he sometimes asked himself uneasily: “What do the neighbours say about our nurse?"
</p><p>
He had his position in the city and had to remember
about it.
</p><p>
Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him.
</p><p>
‘I know she admires you, George,’ Mrs. Darling usually
said, and asked the children to be especially nice to father.
</p><p>
Sometimes they danced together, and their servant Liza
joined them. There never was a simpler, happier family until Peter Pan’s coming.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up
her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good
mother after her children are asleep to put things in order
in their minds. You can find it very interesting to watch your
own mother doing this. It is like tidying up drawers. When
you wake in the morning, on the top of your mind you can
find your good thoughts. All the bad ones are somewhere at
the bottom, because you don’t need them.
</p><p>
We don’t often see maps of persons’ minds. Can you
imagine a map of a child’s mind? There are zigzag lines on
it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, because the Neverland is always
more or less an island, with bright splashes of colour here
and there, and coral reefs, savages and lonely places, and
gnomes who are mostly tailors.
</p><p>
In the Neverland ]ohn lived in a boat turned upside
down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house 
of leaves. ]ohn had no friends, Michael had friends at night,
Wendy had a pet wolf. To these magic shores children always come to play. We did, too; we can still hear the sound
of the surf, but we will never land there again.
</p><p>
In her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling sometimes found things she could not understand.
The strangest of them was the word Peter. She knew of no
Peter, but he was here and there in her children’s minds.
The name stood out in bigger letters than any of the other
words.
‘He looks cocky, this Peter,’ she thought.
</p><p>
‘Yes, he is very cocky,’ Wendy said, when Mrs. Darling
asked her about Peter.
</p><p>
Her mother asked her:
</p><p>
‘But who is he?’
</p><p>
‘He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.’
</p><p>
At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking
back into her childhood she remembered a Peter Pan who
lived with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, the
stories she didn’t believe any more.
</p><p>
She said to Wendy:
</p><p>
‘Oh yes, I believed in him when I was a little girl. But he
must be grown up by this time.’
</p><p>
‘Oh no, he isn’t grown up,’ Wendy said, ‘and he is just my
size.’ She didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling told the story to Mr. Darling, but he just
smiled.
</p><p>
‘Remember my words,’ he said, ‘This is some kind of
nonsense Nana taught them. The dog could easily have such
an idea. They’ll forget it quite soon.’
But they didn’t. And soon this boy gave Mrs. Darling
quite a shock.
</p><p>
One morning Mrs. Darling found some leaves of a tree
on the nursery ﬂoor. They certainly were not there when
the children went to bed. Mrs. Darling couldn’t understand
it, and Wendy said with a smile:
</p><p>
‘I think it is that Peter again!’
</p><p>
‘What do you mean, Wendy?’
</p><p>
‘It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,’ Wendy said.
She was a tidy child.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling still couldn’t understand it, and Wendy explained it all:
</p><p>
‘Peter sometimes comes at nights, and sits on the foot of
my bed, and plays on his pipes to me. It’s a pity I never wake
up to see it. But I know he does.’
</p><p>
‘What are you talking about? No one can get into the
house without knocking.’
</p><p>
‘I think he comes in by the window,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘My love, it is three ﬂoors up.’
</p><p>
‘But the leaves were lying near the window, weren’t
they, mother?’
</p><p>
It was quite true; the leaves were lying near the window.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling did not know what to think. It all seemed
so natural to Wendy. She just couldn’t say:
</p><p>
‘It was only a dream, dear.’
</p><p>
‘My child,’ the mother cried instead, ‘why did you not tell
me of this before?’
</p><p>
‘I forgot,’ said Wendy. She was in a hurry to get her
breakfast.
</p><p>
Oh, surely it was just a dream.
But there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them
very carefully; they were dry leaves, but she was sure they
did not come from any tree that grew in England. She examined the room but didn’t find anything.
</p><p>
Certainly it was just a dream.
</p><p>
But it wasn’t a dream. The next evening proved it. It was
the evening that became the beginning of the children’s
adventures.
</p><p>
On the night we speak ofall the children were once more
in bed. It was Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling bathed
them and sung to them until they fell asleep.
</p><p>
Everything looked so comfortable and so quiet that
Mrs. Darling smiled and sat sewing near the fireplace. By-and-by Mrs. Darling fell asleep. She even began to dream.
She saw that the island of Neverland was quite near and
the strange boy from this island was coming to their house.
There was nothing to worry about, because his face seemed
familiar to her. But in her dream he tore the film that hides
the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael
peeping through the hole.
</p><p>
Maybe her dream doesn’t matter. But while she was
dreaming, the window of the nursery opened and a boy
dropped on the floor. He was not alone: there was also a
strange little light that was rapidly moving around the
room. Mrs. Darling woke up and saw the boy, and somehow
she knew at once that he was Peter Pan.
</p><p>
He was a lovely boy, dressed in dry leaves, but the most
wondering thing about him was that he had all his first
teeth.
</p><p>
He showed them angrily when he saw she was a grown up.
</p>
</div>

	
	<h3><span>CHAPTER 2</span> The Shadow</h3>
<div>

<p>
Mrs. Darling screamed, and at that moment Nana came
in. She growled and leapt at the boy. He rushed out of
the window. Mrs. Darling screamed again, because she
was afraid for the boy, and she ran down into the street to
look for his little body, but it was not there. She looked up,
and in the black night sky she could see only a shooting star.
</p><p>
She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow.
As he leapt at the window Nana shut it quickly, too late to
catch him, but his shadow failed to get out.
</p><p>
You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow
carefully, but it was quite an ordinary one.
</p><p>
Nana knew what to do with this shadow. She hung it out
at the window, meaning:
</p><p>
‘He will come back for it; let’s put it where he can get it
easily without disturbing the children.’
</p><p>
But Mrs. Darling could not let it stay there. The shadow
looked like washing, and it looked quite out of place hanging there. She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away
carefully in a drawer, until she had a chance to tell her husband about it.
</p><p>
The chance came a week later, on that terrible Friday. Of
course it was a Friday.
</p><p>
‘I had to be especially careful on Fridays’, she often said
afterwards to her husband. He sat beside her, and Nana sat
on the other side and held her hand.
‘Oh no, no’, shook his head Mr. Darling. ‘It’s my fault. I,
George Darling, did it all with my own hands’.
</p><p>
So they sat in the evenings, recalling that Friday, even
the smallest details of it.
</p><p>
‘Why did I accept the invitation from neighbours of the
house 27?’ said Mrs. Darling.
</p><p>
‘Why did I pour this stupid medicine in Nana’s bowl?’
said Mr. Darling.
</p><p>
‘Why did I show that I didn’t like that medicine?’ said the
dog with her eyes full of tears.
</p><p>
‘Oh, it’s my love for garden parties, George!’
</p><p>
‘No, my dear, it’s all my stupid sense of humour.’
</p><p>
‘No, it’s my inability not to pay attention to trifles!’ And
then one of them or all three at once started to cry.
</p><p>
But let’s return to that horrible evening.
</p><p>
It began exactly like a hundred other evenings. Nana
filled the bath for Michael and put him on her back to carry
the boy to the bathroom.
</p><p>
‘No, Nana, I won’t go to bed!’ Michael was shouting, like
a person who still believed that the decision depended on
him. ‘I won’t! It is still early! Nana, I won’t love you anymore! I don’t want a bath!’
</p><p>
Then Mrs. Darling entered the room in her white evening
dress. Wendy loved to see her mother in that evening dress.
She was wearing a necklace and a bracelet. The bracelet
belonged to Wendy. But Wendy gladly allowed her mother
to wear it. She often did.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling found her two older children playing at
being their parents. It was Wendy’s birth, and John was
saying:</p><p>
‘I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are
now a mother.’
</p><p>
And Wendy danced with joy. It was very like the real
Mrs. Darling.
</p><p>
Then they had Iohn’s birth, and then Michael came from
his bath. He said:
</p><p>
‘And now it’s my birth.’
</p><p>
But John said:
</p><p>
‘I don’t think so. We don’t want any more children.’
</p><p>
Michael was so unhappy! ‘Nobody wants me,’ he said
sadly. But the lady in the evening dress didn’t think so.
</p><p>
‘I do,’ she said, ‘I so want a third child.’
</p><p>
‘Boy or girl?’ asked Michael.
</p><p>
‘Boy.’
</p><p>
And Michael leapt to her and hugged her. After that
Friday she would often recall it because it was his last
hug.
</p><p>
And then Mr. Darling rushed in the room (‘like a tornado,’
as he usually described it later. And this description is
quite correct.) Perhaps there was some excuse for him.
He was dressing for the party, and everything was well
but his tie. Sometimes he had no problems with it. But
sometimes he just couldn’t tie it properly. And that evening
he absolutely failed to tie it. 
He rushed into the nursery, holding a tie.
</p><p>
‘What’s the matter, father?’
</p><p>
‘Here’s a tie. I can’t tie it!’
</p><p>
He was not sure Mrs. Darling understood the seriousness of the situation, and he continued:
</p><p>
‘I warn you of this, mother, I can’t go to the dinner party
without a tie. It is a very important party, so after missing 
it I can’t go to the office again. So you and I and the children
will starve.’
</p><p>
But even this speech failed to worry Mrs. Darling too
much.
</p><p>
‘Let me try, dear,’ she said, and with her nice cool hands
she tied the tie for him, while the children stood around
looking at them.
</p><p>
The fact that she managed to do it so easily could upset
another man. But not Mr. Darling. He was a good man. He
thanked her and in another moment was dancing round the
room with Michael on his back.
</p><p>
(‘And what a dance it was!’ said Mrs. Darling afterwards.
</p><p>
‘The last dance in our life,’ said Mr. Darling.
</p><p>
‘Oh, George, do you remember, Michael asked me:
“Mother, how did we get acquainted?”’
</p><p>
‘I remember!’
</p><p>
‘They were so sweet, weren’t they, George?’
</p><p>
‘Yes, they were. And they were ours. Ours! And now we
don’t have them!’)
</p><p>
That terrible evening they stopped their dance when
Nana came in, and Mr. Darling ran into her, and fell down,
and they had to brush his trousers. He was very unhappy.
‘That’s because our nurse is a dog,’ he said.
</p><p>
‘George, Nana is a treasure,’ said Mrs. Darling.
</p><p>
‘No doubt, but I have a feeling at times that she looks
upon the children as puppies.’
</p><p>
‘Oh no, dear, I am sure that she knows they have souls.’
</p><p>
‘Maybe,’ Mr. Darling said, ‘maybe.’
</p><p>
It was an opportunity for telling him about the boy. At
first he didn’t believe the story, but then became thoughtful
when she showed him the shadow. 
‘It is nobody I know,’ he said, examining it carefully.
</p><p>
They were still discussing it when Nana came in with
Michael’s medicine. She offered him a spoonful of it, but
Michael didn’t want it.
</p><p>
Mr. Darling was a strong man, but he behaved rather
foolishly about the medicine. Mr. Darling had a weakness.
‘I can take any medicine quite bravely,’ he thought. But he
was wrong. So when Michael refused to take his medicine,
Mr. Darling said:
</p><p>
‘Be a man, Michael.’
</p><p>
‘I don’t want it!’ Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling
left the room to get a chocolate for him. But Mr. Darling
wanted to persuade him.
</p><p>
‘Michael’ he said, ‘when I was your age, I took medicine
without crying. I said: “Thank you, dear parents, for giving
me the medicine to make me well.”’
</p><p>
And he really believed it. Wendy believed it, too. And so
she said to cheer Michael up:
</p><p>
‘That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?’
</p><p>
‘Much nastier,’ Mr. Darling said bravely, ‘I can take it now
to give you a lesson of courage, Michael. Oh, no, I can’t. I lost
the bottle.’
</p><p>
It was not really so. He hid it on the top ofthe wardrobe.
But after Liza’s tidying up it was back on his wash-stand,
and Wendy knew it.
</p><p>
‘I know where it is, father,’ Wendy cried. ‘I’ll bring it,’ and
she was off before he could stop her. Mr. Darling immediately grew unhappy.
</p><p>
‘]ohn’, said he shivering, ‘It is so nasty!’
‘It will soon be over, father’, said John. At this moment
Wendy rushed into the room. She was holding a glass with
the medicine in her hand.
</p><p>
‘I did my best to bring it quickly,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘I see,’ said Mr. Darling with irony in his voice. ‘Just let
Michael drink first.’
</p><p>
‘No, father first,’ said Michael suspiciously.
</p><p>
‘I will be sick, you know,’ warned them Mr. Darling.
</p><p>
‘Come on, father,’ said John.
</p><p>
‘Silence, ]ohn’.
</p><p>
‘I thought you took it quite easily, father,’ Wendy said in
surprise.
</p><p>
‘That’s not the point. It’s not fair. There is more in my
glass that in Michael’s spoon!’ Mr. Darling said angrily.
</p><p>
‘Father, I am waiting’, said Michael coldly.
</p><p>
‘O, really? I’m waiting, too.’
</p><p>
‘Father’s a coward.’
</p><p>
‘No, you are a coward.’
</p><p>
‘I’m not afraid.’
</p><p>
‘And I’m not afraid.’
</p><p>
‘Well, then, take it.’
</p><p>
‘Well, then, you take it.’
</p><p>
Wendy had an idea. ‘You can do it at the same time,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘Of course,’ replied Mr. Darling. ‘Are you ready, Michael?’
</p><p>
Wendy said, ‘One, two, three!’ and Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling didn’t. He hid his glass behind his back.
</p><p>
There came an angry shout from Michael and ‘Oh,
father!’ from Wendy.
</p><p>
‘What do you mean by “Oh, father”?’ Mr. Darling asked
bravely. ‘Stop it, Michael. I was going to take my medicine.
I just somehow missed the glass.’
It was a terrible moment. The children were looking
at him, and it seemed they did not admire him. ‘Let’s have
some fun,’ he said bravely, ‘Nana went out ofthe room. I will
pour my medicine into her bowl. She will come back and
drink it, thinking it is milk!’
</p><p>
It was the colour of milk; but children did not have their
father’s sense of humour, and as they watched him pouring
the medicine into Nana’s bowl it seemed they didn’t like
the idea. But they did not dare to warn Nana when she and
Mrs. Darling entered the room.
</p><p>
‘Nana, good dog,’ Mr. Darling said, ‘I poured some milk
into your bowl, Nana.’
</p><p>
Nana wagged her tail, ran to the bowl, and began lapping. She stopped and looked at Mr. Darling with her eyes
full of tears and went into her kennel.
</p><p>
In a horrible silence Mrs. Darling came to the bowl and
smelt it.
</p><p>
‘Oh, George, it’s your medicine!’
</p><p>
‘It was a joke!’ Mr. Darling shouted angrily. ‘I’m doing my
best to make you laugh, but you never do!’
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling was comforting the boys, and Wendy
hugged Nana.
</p><p>
‘So the dog is the chief person in the nursery, isn’t she?’
he shouted. ‘Enough! I will stop it right now!’
</p><p>
The children cried, and Nana hurried to him wagging
her tail to say ‘I’m sorry,’ but Mr. Darling pushed her away.
He felt he was a strong man again.
</p><p>
‘Go out! Your place is in the yard. And you’re going to
stay there! I will tie you up.’
</p><p>
‘George, George,’ Mrs. Darling whispered, ‘remember
what I told you about that boy.’ But he didn’t listen to her.
He dragged Nana out of the nursery and tied her up in the
backyard. He was terribly ashamed and very unhappy.
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling was putting the children to bed. In the nursery
there was an unusual silence. She lit the bedside lamp.
They could hear Nana’s barking in the yard, and John said:
</p><p>
‘It is because he is tying her up in the yard.’ But Wendy
didn’t think so.
</p><p>
‘That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,’ she said, ‘that is her
bark when she smells danger.’
</p><p>
Danger!
</p><p>
‘Are you sure, Wendy?’
</p><p>
‘Oh, yes.’
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling went to the window and looked out of
the window. The sky was full of stars. Some strange fear
gripped her heart.
</p><p>
Michael asked: ‘Can anything harm us, mother, after you
lit the lamp?’
</p><p>
‘Nothing,’ she said; ‘such lamps are the eyes a mother
leaves behind her to guard her children.’
</p><p>
She went from bed to bed and little Michael hugged her.
</p><p>
‘Mother,’ he cried, ‘I’m glad of you.’ They were the last
words she heard from him for a long time.
</p><p>
No. 27 was only a few yards away, but there was snow-
ing, and Mr. and Mrs. Darling were walking carefully, minding
their clean shoes. The street was empty. Only stars over
their heads were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but
they may not take an active part in anything, they must just
look on forever. But the young stars are so fond of fun that
they were on Peter’s side tonight. So as soon as the door
of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling, the smallest of all the
stars in the Milky Way shouted:
</p><p>
‘Now, Peter!’
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 3</span> Come Away, Coma Away!</h3>
<div>


<p>
For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the
bedside lamps of the three children were burning clearly.
But after a short while they blinked and went out.
</p><p>
There was another light in the room now, a thousand
times brighter than the bedside lamps. It was rushing
through the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s
shadow. It was not really a light; it was a fairy, no longer
than your hand, but still growing. It was a fairy girl called
Tinker Bell. She wore a nice dry leaf dress.
</p><p>
A moment after the fairy’s coming, Peter Pan dropped in
through the same window.
</p><p>
‘Tinker Bell,’ he called quietly, after making sure that the
children were asleep, ‘Tink, where are you? Do you know
where my shadow is?’
</p><p>
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It
was the fairy language.
</p><p>
‘The shadow is here, in the big box,’ Tinker Bell said.
</p><p>
She meant the chest of drawers. Peter rushed to it and
pulled out all the drawers one after another. He was throwing
clothes and everything straight onto the ﬂoor. In a moment
he found his shadow and was so happy that he immediately
shut the drawer and did not notice that Tinker Bell
was inside it.
</p><p>
Maybe Peter believed that he and his shadow would immediately
join like drops of water. Maybe he didn’t think
about it at all. Anyway, they didn’t, and he had no idea what 
to do. He tried to stick it on with soap, but failed. He sat on
the floor and cried.
His crying woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed.
</p><p>
‘Boy,’ she said, ‘why are you crying?’
</p><p>
Peter knew how to be polite; he learned good manners
at the parties of the fairies. So he rose and bowed to her
elegantly. Wendy liked it very much, and bowed to him elegantly from bed.
</p><p>
‘What’s your name?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘Wendy Moira Angela Darling,’ she answered. She liked
the sound of her full name. ‘What is your name?’
</p><p>
‘Peter Pan.’
</p><p>
She was sure that he must be Peter, but it seemed to be
a very short name.
</p><p>
‘Is that all?’
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that
it was really a short name.
</p><p>
‘I’m so sorry,’ said Wendy Moira Angela.
</p><p>
‘It doesn’t matter,’ Peter answered.
</p><p>
‘Where do you live?’ Wendy asked.
</p><p>
‘Second turn to the right,’ said Peter, ‘and then straight
on till morning.’
</p><p>
‘What a funny address!’
</p><p>
Peter felt that perhaps it was a funny address.
</p><p>
‘No, it isn’t,’ he said.
</p><p>
‘I mean, is that what they write on the letters?’ Wendy
asked.
</p><p>
‘I don’t get any letters,’ he said carelessly.
</p><p>
‘But your mother gets letters, doesn’t she?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t have a mother,’ he said. And he didn’t want to have
any mother. But Wendy felt at once that there was a tragedy.
‘O Peter, no wonder you were crying,’ she said, and got
out of bed and ran to him.
</p><p>
‘I wasn’t crying about mothers,’ he said in surprise. ‘I
was crying because I can’t make my shadow stick on. And
then, I wasn’t crying.’
</p><p>
Then Wendy saw the shadow on the ﬂoor, and she was
sorry for Peter.
</p><p>
‘How awful!’ she said.
</p><p>
Fortunately she knew at once what to do.
</p><p>
‘I will sew it on,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘What do you mean?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘You’re very ignorant.’
</p><p>
‘No, I’m not.’
</p><p>
‘I will sew it on for you, my little man,’ she said, though
he was as tall as herself, and she got out her little box with
needles and threads and everything, and sewed the shadow
on to Peter’s foot.
</p><p>
‘It will hurt, I’m afraid,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘I won’t cry,’ answered Peter. And he didn’t. And soon his
shadow was in its proper place.
</p><p>
‘It needs ironing,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
But Peter, boylike, didn’t care about appearances. He
was jumping around the room in wild joy. He was happy
he got his shadow back. And he was quite sure he did it
all by himself, and he immediately forgot about Wendy’s
help.
</p><p>
‘How clever I am!’ he was shouting.
</p><p>
It was quite a shock for Wendy.
</p><p>
‘Do you mean I did nothing?’ she asked.
</p><p>
‘You did a little,’ Peter answered carelessly, and continued to dance.
‘A little!’ Wendy repeated. She was quite angry. ‘Well, if
I am no use, I can go away!’
</p><p>
And she leapt into bed and covered her face with the
blankets.
</p><p>
He wanted to make her look up and pretended to be going away.
But it didn’t help. Then he sat down on the edge
of the bed and touched her gently with his foot.
</p><p>
‘Wendy’ he said, ‘don’t go away. I always behave like this
when I’m happy with myself.’
</p><p>
Wendy didn’t look up, but she was listening.
</p><p>
‘Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.’
</p><p>
At this Wendy couldn’t help looking up.
</p><p>
‘Do you really think so, Peter?’
</p><p>
‘Yes, I do.’
</p><p>
‘You are very nice,’ she said, ‘and I’ll get up again,’ and
she sat with him on the side of the bed.
</p><p>
‘I can give you a kiss, if you’d like,’ she added. Peter
agreed, but he did not know what she meant. So he held
out his hand, waiting for the thing she offered.
</p><p>
‘Surely you know what a kiss is?’ Wendy asked in surprise.
</p><p>
‘I will know when you give it to me,’ he said, and not to
hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.
</p><p>
‘Now,’ said he, ‘shall I give you a kiss?’
</p><p>
‘If you wish to,’ Wendy answered. And she turned her
head slightly towards him, but Peter just dropped an acorn
button into her hand.
</p><p>
‘Thank you,’ Wendy said. ‘I will wear your kiss on this
chain around my neck.’
</p><p>
She attached it to the chain that was around her neck. It
was lucky that she did it. One day it will save her life.
When people meet, they usually ask questions, and
among other things they ask one’s age. Wendy was a polite
girl. So she asked Peter, ‘How old are you?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t know,’ he answered uneasily, ‘but I am quite
young.’ He really knew nothing about it, he could only guess.
‘Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.’
</p><p>
It surprised Wendy, and interested her, too.
</p><p>
‘It was because I heard father and mother,’ he explained
in a low voice, ‘talking about what I was to be when I became
a man. But I don’t want ever to be a man,’ he said with
passion. ‘I want always to be a little boy and to have fun.
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long time
among the fairies.’
</p><p>
She looked at him with admiration. ‘That’s because I ran
away!’ Peter thought. ‘He knows fairies!’ Wendy thought.
She asked him a lot of questions about fairies, and it 
surprised him. For him, there was nothing extraordinary about
fairies, they were getting in his way, and so on. But he
liked them, and he told Wendy about the beginning of the
fairies:
</p><p>
‘You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first
time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and each of them
turned into a fairy, and that was the beginning of fairies.
And so there must be one fairy for every boy and girl.’
</p><p>
‘Must be? Isn’t there?’
</p><p>
‘No. You see, children know such a lot now, they soon
don’t believe in fairies. And every time a child says, “I don’t
believe in fairies,” some fairy somewhere falls down dead.’
</p><p>
Suddenly he remembered Tinker Bell, and it surprised
him that she was so quiet.
</p><p>
‘Tinker Bell, where are you?’
‘Peter!’ Wendy cried eagerly. ‘Do you mean to tell me
that there is a fairy in this room?’
</p><p>
‘She was here just now,’ he said a little impatiently. ‘You
don’t hear her, do you?’ and they both listened.
</p><p>
‘The only sound I hear,’ said Wendy, ‘is like a tinkle of
bells.’
</p><p>
‘Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear
hertoof
</p><p>
The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter
made a merry face.
</p><p>
‘Wendy,’ he whispered, ‘I believe I shut her up in the
drawer!’
</p><p>
He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she ﬂew about
the nursery shouting angrily. ‘You shouldn’t say such things,’
Peter said. ‘Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know
you were in the drawer?’
</p><p>
Wendy was not listening to him.
</p><p>
‘O Peter,’ she cried, ‘can she stand still for a moment and
let me see her?’
</p><p>
‘They hardly ever stand still,’ he said, but for one 
moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the
cuckoo clock.
</p><p>
‘O, she is so lovely!’ she cried.
</p><p>
‘Tink,’ said Peter, ‘this lady wishes you were her fairy.’
</p><p>
Tinker Bell answered angrily.
</p><p>
‘What does she say, Peter?’
</p><p>
‘She is not very polite. She says, “The girl is ugly, and I’m
your fairy,”’ said Peter. ‘You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,
because I am a gentleman and you are a lady.’
</p><p>
‘You fool,’ Tink answered and disappeared into the
bathroom. ‘She is quite a common fairy,’ Peter explained,
 ‘her name is Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and
kettles.’</p><p>
They were together in the armchair by this time, and
Wendy was asking him more questions:
</p><p>
‘You don’t live in Kensington Gardens now, do you?’
</p><p>
‘Sometimes I do still.’
</p><p>
‘But where do you live mostly now?’
</p><p>
‘With the lost boys.’
</p><p>
‘Who are they?’
</p><p>
‘They are the children who fall out of their prams, while the
nurse is looking the other way. There are seven days to claim
such a child, and then they go to the Neverland. I’m captain.’
</p><p>
‘What fun it must be!’

‘Yes,’ said Peter, ‘but we are rather lonely. There are no
girls with us.’
</p><p>
‘Are none of the others girls?’
</p><p>
‘Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out
of their prams.’
</p><p>
Wendy liked the idea.
</p><p>
‘I think,’ she said, ‘it is perfectly lovely the way you talk
about girls; ]ohn there just despises us.’
</p><p>
Peter didn’t answer. He just rose and kicked ]ohn out of
bed, blankets and all; one kick. This seemed too much for
Wendy, and she told him with passion:
</p><p>
‘Peter! You are not captain in this house.’
</p><p>
But John continued to sleep peacefully on the ﬂoor.
</p><p>
‘And I know you meant to be kind,’ she said, ‘so you may
give me a kiss.’
</p><p>
She forgot his ignorance about kisses.
</p><p>
‘I thought you would want it back,’ he sighed and offered
to return her the thimble.
‘Oh, no,’ said the nice Wendy, ‘I don’t mean a kiss, I mean
a thimble.’
</p><p>
‘What’s that?’
</p><p>
‘It’s like this.’ She kissed him.
</p><p>
‘Funny!’ said Peter quite seriously. ‘Now shall I give you
a thimble?’
</p><p>
‘Ifyou wish to,’ said Wendy.
</p><p>
Peter kissed her, and almost immediately she screamed.
</p><p>
‘What is it, Wendy?’
</p><p>
‘It was like someone was pulling my hair.’
</p><p>
‘That’s Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.’
</p><p>
And indeed Tink was ﬂying around the room, using offensive language.
</p><p>
‘She says, “I will do it to her every time you give her
a thimble.”’
</p><p>
‘But why?’
</p><p>
‘Why, Tink?’
</p><p>
Again Tink answered, ‘You fool.’ Peter could not understand
why, but Wendy understood. And it disappointed her
a little when Peter said, ‘You know, Wendy, I came to the
nursery window to listen to stories. You see, I don’t know
any stories. None of the lost boys knows any stories.’
</p><p>
‘How awful,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘O, Wendy, your mother was telling you such a lovely story.’
</p><p>
‘Which story was it?’
</p><p>
‘About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore
the glass slipper.’
</p><p>
‘Peter,’ said Wendy excitedly, ‘that was Cinderella, and he
found her, and they lived happily ever after.’
</p><p>
Peter was so glad that he rose from the ﬂoor, and hurried to the window.
‘Where are you going?’ she cried.
</p><p>
‘To tell the other boys.’
</p><p>
‘Don’t go, Peter,’ she cried, ‘I know such lots of stories.’
</p><p>
Peter moved away from the window. There was a greedy
look in his eyes, but somehow it didn’t frighten Wendy.
</p><p>
‘I can tell all kinds of stories to the boys!’ said Wendy.
</p><p>
And Peter took her hand and drew her to the window.
</p><p>
‘Let me go!’ she exclaimed.
</p><p>
‘Wendy, come with me and tell the other boys,’ he asked.
</p><p>
She liked it, but she said:
</p><p>
‘How can I? Think of mother! And besides, I can’t ﬂy.’
</p><p>
‘I’ll teach you.’
</p><p>
‘Oh, how lovely to fly!’
</p><p>
‘I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then
we’ll go away.’
</p><p>
‘Oo!’ she exclaimed.
</p><p>
‘Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed
you might be ﬂying about with me saying funny things to
the stars.’
</p><p>
‘Oo!’
</p><p>
‘And, Wendy, there are mermaids.’
</p><p>
‘Mermaids! With tails?’
</p><p>
‘Such long tails.’
</p><p>
‘Oh,’ cried Wendy, ‘to see a mermaid!’
</p><p>
‘And we will respect you, Wendy, all of us!’
</p><p>
Wendy was full of excitement. She didn’t know what to do.
</p><p>
But he had no pity for her.
</p><p>
‘You can mend our clothes, and make pockets for us. No
one of us has any pockets.’
</p><p>
How could she refuse?
</p><p>
‘Peter, could you teach John and Michael to ﬂy too?’
‘If you like,’ he said indifferently, and she ran to John and
Michael and shook them. ‘Wake up,’ she cried, ‘Peter Pan is
here, and he is going to teach us to ﬂy.’
</p><p>
]ohn opened his eyes. ‘Then I shall get up,’ he said. Of
course he was on the ﬂoor already. ‘I am up!’ he said.
</p><p>
Michael also got up.
</p><p>
But Peter suddenly signed silence, and they listened
eagerly. There was no barking. Nana was silent. It seemed
there was dead silence.
</p><p>
‘Turn off the light! Hide! Quick!’ cried Iohn. He was 
captain know. But it was the only time throughout their 
adventure. When Lisa came into the bedroom, holding Nana, it
seemed that all three were sleeping peacefully.
</p><p>
Lisa was angry, because she was mixing the Christmas
puddings in the kitchen, and she grew tired of Nana’s 
barking. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to
take Nana to the nursery for a moment.
</p><p>
‘Don’t you see, you silly dog? They’re perfectly safe,
aren’t they? Every one of the little angels is sleeping in
bed. Listen to their breathing.’
</p><p>
Here Michael began to breathe so loudly that Nana grew
suspicious. She knew that kind of breathing. She tried to
rush to the beds, but Liza didn’t let her.
</p><p>
‘Stop it, Nana’, she said, pulling her out of the room. ‘And
don’t you start barking again, or I will go straight to the
party and tell Mr. and Mrs. Darling, and bring them from the
party. The master will punish you.’
</p><p>
She tied the unhappy dog up in the yard again, but do you
think Nana stopped barking? Bring Mr. and Mrs. Darling from
the party? That was just what she wanted! And she didn’t
care about punishment as long as the children were safe.
But Lisa returned to her puddings, and Nana saw that no
help would come from her. So she began to pull the chain as
hard as she could, and at last she broke it. A moment later
she burst into the living-room of the house number 27, and
Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible
was happening in the nursery. They rushed into the street
without even saying good-bye to the hostess.
</p><p>
But it was ten minutes after Nana’s visit to the nursery,
and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.
</p><p>
We now return to the nursery.
</p><p>
‘It’s all right,’ John said, appearing from his hiding place.
‘Peter, can you really ﬂy?’
</p><p>
Peter didn’t answer. He just ﬂew around the room.
</p><p>
‘How excellent!’ said John and Michael.
</p><p>
‘How sweet!’ cried Wendy.
</p><p>
‘Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!’ said Peter, forgetting his
manners again.
</p><p>
It looked very easy, and they tried it first from the ﬂoor and
then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
</p><p>
‘How do you do it?’ asked Iohn, rubbing his knee. He was
quite a practical boy.
</p><p>
‘You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,’ Peter explained, ‘and they lift you up in the air.’
</p><p>
He showed them again.
</p><p>
‘You’re so quick,’ John said, ‘could you do it very slowly
once?’
</p><p>
Peter did it both slowly and quickly. ‘I’ve got it now, 
Wendy!’ cried ]ohn, but he was wrong. Not one ofthem could ﬂy.
</p><p>
Peter was playing a trick on them, of course. One can fly
only if he or she has some fairy dust on them. Fortunately,
Peter had some fairy’s dust on his hand after carrying Tinker
 Bell on their way to the Darlings. So he blew some ofthe
dust on each of them, and they tried again.
They were all on their beds, and Michael let go first. He
didn’t mean to let go. But he did it, and next moment he was
flying about the room.
</p><p>
‘I’m ﬂying!’ he cried.
</p><p>
John and Wendy followed him.
</p><p>
‘Great!’
</p><p>
‘Lovely!’
</p><p>
‘Look at me!’
</p><p>
‘Look at me!’
</p><p>
‘Look at me!’
</p><p>
They were not so elegant as Peter. But still they were
flying, up and down, and round and round the room.
</p><p>
‘Let’s go out!’ cried ]ohn.
</p><p>
Of course it was just the thing Peter wanted.
</p><p>
Michael was ready to go. But Wendy wasn’t sure.
</p><p>
‘Mermaids!’ said Peter again.
</p><p>
‘Oo!’
</p><p>
‘And there are pirates.’
</p><p>
‘Pirates,’ cried Iohn, ‘let us go at once.’ And he took his hat.
</p><p>
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried
with Nana out of 27. They ran into the middle of the
street to look up at the nursery window. There was light in
the room, and they could see in shadow on the curtain three
little figures moving round and round, not on the ﬂoor but
in the air.
</p><p>
Not three figures, four!
</p><p>
They hurriedly opened the street door. Mr. Darling was
going to run upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go
softly. She even tried to make her heart beat softly.
But the little stars were watching them. The stars blew
the window open again, and the smallest star of all shouted:
</p><p>
‘Come away, Peter!’
</p><p>
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose.
</p><p>
‘Let’s go!’ he shouted and immediately ﬂew out of the
window into the night, and Wendy, John and Michael followed him.
</p><p>
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery
too late. The nest was empty.
</p>

		<h3><span>CHAPTER 4</span> The Flight</h3>
<div>


<p>
Second turn to the right, and straight on till morning.’
</p><p>
That was the way to the Neverland, as Peter
said. But even for the birds it would be impossible to find
their way there with these instructions. Peter just said 
anything that came into his head.
</p><p>
At first Wendy and the boys trusted him absolutely. They
admired flying and laughed, remembering their first ﬂying
attempts. How much time passed since they first tried it?
They were ﬂying over the sea before this thought began to
disturb Wendy seriously. ]ohn thought it was their second
sea and their third night.
</p><p>
Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, sometimes
they were very cold and sometimes too warm. They were
very sleepy, and that was a danger, because as soon as they 
fell asleep, they fell down. The awful thing was that Peter
thought it funny.
‘There he goes again!’ cried Peter, as Michael suddenly
dropped like a stone.
</p><p>
‘Save him, save him!’ cried Wendy, looking with horror
at the cruel sea far below.
</p><p>
And Peter followed him and caught him just before he
could strike the sea. He did it very gracefully and cleverly.
But he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it
was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving
of human life.
</p><p>
Peter could sleep in the air without falling, just lying on
his back and ﬂoating.
</p><p>
‘Be more polite to him,’ Wendy whispered to John.
</p><p>
‘Then tell him to stop showing off’, said John.
</p><p>
‘You must be nice to him,’ Wendy said to her brothers.
‘He can leave us right here! What shall we do then?’
</p><p>
‘We could go back,’ Michael said.
</p><p>
‘How could we ever find our way back without him?’
</p><p>
‘Well, then, we could go on,’ said John.
</p><p>
‘This is the awful thing, Iohn. We have to go on, because
we don’t know how to stop.’
</p><p>
This was true.
</p><p>
‘So’, said Iohn’, we’ll ﬂy and ﬂy around the world, and in
some time we must come back to our own window.’
</p><p>
Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt
rather lonely up there by themselves.
</p><p>
Sometimes when he returned he did not remember
them, at least not well. Wendy was sure ofit. Once she even
had to call him by name:
</p><p>
‘Peter! I am Wendy!’
He was very sorry. ‘Listen, Wendy,’ he whispered to her,
‘always ifyou see me forgetting you, just keep on saying “I’m
Wendy,” and then I’ll remember.’
</p><p>
After many moons they finally reached the Neverland,
and not so much because Peter and Tinker Bell knew the
way, as because the island was looking for them. It is the
only way to get there.
</p><p>
‘There it is,’ said Peter calmly.
</p><p>
‘Where, where?’
</p><p>
‘Where all the arrows are pointing.’
</p><p>
Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to
the children, all directed by the sun, who wanted them to be
sure of their way before leaving them for the night.
</p><p>
Wendy, John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to see
the island as soon as possible. Strange to say, they all 
recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they greeted
it as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home
for the holidays.
</p><p>
‘]ohn, there’s the lagoon.’
</p><p>
‘Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.’
</p><p>
‘Listen, John, I see your ﬂamingo with the broken leg!’
</p><p>
‘Look, Michael, there’s your cave!’
</p><p>
‘]ohn, what’s that in the bushes?’
</p><p>
‘It’s a wolf with the little ones. Wendy, I think that’s your
little pet wolf among them!’
</p><p>
‘There’s my boat, Iohn!’
</p><p>
‘No, it isn’t. We burned your boat.’
</p><p>
‘That’s my boat, I’m sure. Oh, John, I see the smoke of
the Indian camp!’
</p><p>
‘Where? Show me.’
</p><p>
‘There, just across the Mysterious River.’
‘I see now.’
</p><p>
Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so
much about his island. And of course, they knew the 
Neverland. But the Neverland can be frightening, you know. Even
at home it can seem dark and threatening by bedtime. And
now it was real, and there was no bedside lamp, and Nana...
where was she?
</p><p>
The children gathered around Peter, and he was not
careless anymore, but eager and energetic. They were 
ﬂying low and very slowly, as if they had to push their way
through hostile forces.
</p><p>
‘They don’t want us to land,’ Peter explained.
</p><p>
‘Who are they?’ Wendy whispered.
</p><p>
But he could not say. Tinker Bell was sleeping on his
shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.
</p><p>
‘Would you like an adventure now,’ he said to John, ‘or
would you like to have your tea first?’
</p><p>
Wendy said ‘Tea first’ quickly, and Michael pressed her
hand in gratitude, but the braver ]ohn wasn’t sure.
</p><p>
‘What kind of adventure?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,’
Peter told him. ‘If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.’
</p><p>
‘I don’t see him,’ John said after a long pause.
</p><p>
‘I do.’
</p><p>
‘He can wake up. What shall we do?’ ]ohn asked.
</p><p>
‘You don’t think I would kill him while he was sleeping!
I will wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I
always do.’
</p><p>
‘Oh! Did you kill many?’
</p><p>
‘Lots of them.’
‘Are there many pirates on the island just now?’ John
asked.
</p><p>
‘Lots of them,’ Peter repeated.
</p><p>
‘Who is their captain now?’
</p><p>
‘Hook,’ answered Peter.
</p><p>
‘Ias. Hook?’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
Michael began to cry, and John spoke with difficulty, because they knew Hook’s reputation.
</p><p>
‘He is the worst of them all,’ John whispered. ‘He is the
only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.’
</p><p>
‘That’s him,’ said Peter.
</p><p>
‘What is he like? Is he big?’
</p><p>
‘He is not so big as he was.’
</p><p>
‘What do you mean?’
</p><p>
‘I cut off a bit of him.’
</p><p>
‘You!’
</p><p>
‘Yes, me,’ said Peter.
</p><p>
‘What bit?’
</p><p>
‘His right hand.’
</p><p>
‘Then he can’t fight now?’
</p><p>
‘Oh, he can!’
</p><p>
‘Left-hander?’
</p><p>
‘He has an iron hook instead of his right hand, and he
claws with it.’
</p><p>
‘Claws!’
</p><p>
‘Listen, Iohn,’ said Peter.
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘Say, “Yes, sir.”’
</p><p>
‘Yes, yes sir.’
‘There is one thing,’ Peter continued, ‘that every boy
</p><p>
who serves under me must promise, and so must you.’
</p><p>
John paled.
</p><p>
‘It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave
him to me.’
</p><p>
‘I promise,’ John said.
</p><p>
For the moment they were feeling more cheerful, 
because Tink was ﬂying with them, and in her light they could
see each other. Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly,
and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in
which they moved.
</p><p>
‘She told me something,’ Peter said. ‘The pirates noticed
us before the darkness, and got Long Tom out.’
</p><p>
‘The big gun?’
</p><p>
‘Yes. And of course they must see her light. Hope they
won’t guess we are near it, or they’ll fire it.’
</p><p>
‘Wendy!’
</p><p>
john?
</p><p>
‘Michael!’
</p><p>
‘Tell her to go away at once, Peter,’ the children cried,
but he refused.
</p><p>
‘She thinks we managed to lose the way,’ he said, ‘and
she is afraid. I will not send her away by herself when she
is afraid!’
</p><p>
For a moment Tink stopped going round the children
and gave Peter a loving little pinch.
</p><p>
‘Then tell her,’ Wendy said, ‘to put out her light.’
</p><p>
‘She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies
can’t do. It just goes out ofitselfwhen she falls asleep, same
as the stars.’
</p><p>
‘Then tell her to sleep at once,’ ]ohn almost ordered.
‘She can’t sleep when she isn’t sleepy. It is the only other
thing fairies can’t do.’
</p><p>
‘We could carry her in a pocket.’ Peter said after a pause,
‘but we don’t have any.’
</p><p>
It was true. But Peter had a happy idea. ]ohn’s hat!
</p><p>
Tink agreed to travel by hat and John carried it. But then
John said, ‘The hat keeps pushing my knees,’ and Wendy
took it. And later this led to trouble, because Tinker Bell
didn’t like Wendy at all.
</p><p>
They were ﬂying in dead silence. There were some
strange sounds sometimes, and Peter explained them, ‘Do
you hear this sound? Wild beasts are drinking! And do you
hear this new sound? The Indians are sharpening their
knives!’ But soon even these frightening sounds stopped.
To Michael it was awful. ‘I really want something to make a
sound!’ he cried.
</p><p>
As soon as he said it, they heard a tremendous crash. It
was a shot of Long Tom.
</p><p>
This sound echoed through the mountains, and the
echoes seemed to cry savagely, ‘Where are they, where are
they, where are they?’ The wind of the shot separated the
little group.
</p><p>
After the crash and confusion of the shot John and 
Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. Fortunately,
they were still in the air and still moving.
</p><p>
‘Are you all right?’ ]ohn whispered.
</p><p>
‘I don’t know yet,’ Michael whispered back.
</p><p>
He was all right, and everyone else was. But Peter was
far from them above the sea, and Wendy was high above
them, with Tinker Bell in Iohn’s hat.
Tink was not all bad. Well, she was all bad at the 
moment, but sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be
one thing or other, because they are too small to hold more
than one emotion at a time. Now Tink was full ofjealousy
of Wendy. So she flew out of the hat and started ﬂying back
and forward. Wendy didn’t understand fairies’ language,
but Tink’s movements plainly meant, ‘Follow me, and all
will be well.’
</p><p>
What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter,
John and Michael, but no one answered. She didn’t know
that Tinker Bell hated her. So she followed the fairy to her

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 5</span> The Island Comes True</h3>
<div>


<p>
Pen Peter is away, things are usually quiet on the
Wfsland.
</p><p>
Fairies sleep late in the morning, the beasts
are busy with their young, the Indians have long feasts, and
when the pirates and the lost boys meet, nothing happens.
But then Peter comes back, and they all wake into life.
</p><p>
On this evening the lost boys were out looking for Peter,
the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the Indians
were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out
looking for the Indians. They were going round and round
</p><p>
the island, but they did not meet because all were going at
the same speed.
All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule,
but tonight were out to welcome their captain. At this time
there were six lost boys on the island, counting twins as
two. Let’s pretend to lie here in the bushes and watch them
walking quietly in a line. Peter forbade them to look like
him, and they wear the skins of bears, in which they are so
round and furry that when they fall they roll.
</p><p>
The first boy in the line is Tootles, not the least brave
but the most unfortunate ofthem. He often misses great 
adventures, because they always happen as soon as he turns
round the corner. For example, when all is quiet, he goes off
to gather some firewood, and when he returns the others
are cleaning the place after a great battle.
</p><p>
Poor kind Tootles, you are in danger tonight. Fairy
Tinker Bell, who is all bad at the moment, is looking for
a tool to make mischief, and she wants to trick you. But
we are not really there, and he can’t hear our warning.
</p><p>
Next comes Nibs, the most cheerful of them, and next
comes Slightly. Slightly thinks he remembers the time when
he wasn’t a lost boy, that’s why he walks with his nose in
the air. The fourth is Curley. He always gets into trouble, and
when Peter asks ‘Who did it?’ he steps forward 
automatically, even if this time it’s not his fault. Last come the Twins,
and it is no use to describe them because we will surely
describe the wrong one.
</p><p>
The boys disappear in the darkness, and soon after that
the pirates come on their track. They are walking in a line,
too. But before we see them, we can hear their terrible
song.
</p><p>
The first one, with his head to the ground, is 
Italian Cecco. The black giant behind him has many names.
The tattooed pirate behind him is Bill Iukes, and then
comes Cookson. They say that he is the brother of Black
Murphy, but no one could prove it. The next one is 
Gentleman Starkey who once worked in public school. Then
Smee comes, a genial Irish pirate who kills his victims
with simplicity unusual in the company. And he is not the
last one. Many other horrible pirates are walking in the
line.
</p><p>
Among them is the horrible Iames Hook, or Ias. Hook
(that’s how he writes his name). He lies in a sort of chariot
his men are drawing, and he has an iron hook instead of
his right hand. He treats his people cruelly, and they obey
him absolutely. His face is dark, his hair is black, his eyes
are blue. He is never more dangerous than when he is most
polite. In the mouth he holds a special device of his own
invention which lets him smoke two cigars at once.
</p><p>
Such is the enemy of Peter Pan. Which will win?
</p><p>
On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly, come the
Indians. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked
bodies gleam with paint and oil. The first one is brave Great
Big Little Panther, he is moving on all fours. The last one is
Tiger Lily, their beautiful princess. The Indians move 
noiselessly. The only sound is their heavy breathing. It’s not easy
to walk like this after all the feasts they had.
</p><p>
The Indians disappear, and wild beasts come on their
track. Here are lions, tigers, bears and others. On this night
they are all hungry.
</p><p>
After them comes the last figure of all — a gigantic 
crocodile. Soon we shall see for whom it is looking.
</p><p>
The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again,
because the procession must continue until one of the 
groups stops or changes its speed. Then quickly they will
be on top of each other.
All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none 
suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind. This
shows how real the island was.
</p><p>
Finally the boys stopped it and sat down on the lawn
near their underground home.
</p><p>
‘I hope Peter will come back soon,’ every one of them
said nervously.
</p><p>
‘I am the only one who is not afraid ofthe pirates,’ 
Slightly said, and one could easily see why he wasn’t the general
favorite, ‘but I hope Peter will come back soon, and tell us
more about Cinderella.’
</p><p>
They talked of Cinderella.
</p><p>
‘My mother was very like her,’ Tootles said.
</p><p>
Peter didn’t let them talk about mothers. He thought
it silly. So they could speak about them only without
Peter.
</p><p>
‘All I remember about my mother,’ Nibs told them, ‘is
that she often said to my father, ”Oh, what I really want is a
cheque-book of my own!” I don’t know what a cheque-book
is, but I should just love to give my mother one.’
</p><p>
While they were talking they heard a distant sound. It
was the pirate song.
</p><p>
At once the lost boys — but where are they? They are
no longer there.
</p><p>
All ofthem are already in their home under the ground —
all but Nibs who hurried to have a look at the pirates. Do
you see any door? Look closer, and you may note seven
large trees, each with a hole as large as a boy. These are
the seven entrances to the home under the ground. Captain 
Hook keeps looking for the entrance, but he can’t find it.
Will he find it tonight?
While the pirates were going, Starkey noticed Nibs 
disappearing through the woods. He drew out his pistol at
once, but an iron claw gripped his shoulder.
</p><p>
‘Captain, let go!’ Starkey cried. ‘I was just going to shoot
one of the boys you hate.’
</p><p>
Now for the first time we can hear the voice of Hook. It
was a black voice.
</p><p>
‘Oh yes, and Tiger Lily’s Indians will hear the shot and
come here in a minute. Do you want to lose your scalp?’
</p><p>
‘My knife doesn’t make any noise,’ said Smee.
</p><p>
‘Not now, Smee,’ Hook said darkly. ‘He is only one, and I
want all the seven. Look for them.’
</p><p>
The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a 
moment their Captain and Smee were alone.
</p><p>
‘Most of all I hate their captain, Peter Pan,’ Hook said.
‘He cut off my arm. But I hope to shake his hand with this.
Oh, I’ll tear him! He threw my arm to a crocodile that was
passing by.’
</p><p>
‘It seems you are afraid of crocodiles’, said Smee.
</p><p>
‘Not of crocodiles,’ Hook corrected him, ‘but of that one
crocodile.’ He lowered his voice. ‘It liked my arm so much,
Smee, that it keeps following me ever since, from sea to sea
and from land to land, looking for the rest of me.’
</p><p>
‘In a way,’ said Smee, ‘it’s sort of a compliment.’
</p><p>
‘I want no such compliments,’ Hook said.
</p><p>
He sat down on a large mushroom and continued:
</p><p>
‘Luckily, the crocodile ate my arm with the clock. And it
keeps ticking inside it. And I run away as soon as I hear the
ticking.’ And he laughed.
‘Smee,’ he said suddenly, ‘this seat is hot.’ He jumped up.
‘I’m burning!’
</p><p>
They examined the mushroom. It was very big and thick.
They tried to pull it up and it came away at once in their
hands, because it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began
at once to rise. The pirates looked at each other.
</p><p>
‘A chimney!’ they both exclaimed.
</p><p>
It was the chimney of the home under the ground. The
boys usually stopped it with a mushroom when enemies
were so near.
</p><p>
Not only smoke came out of it. There came also 
children’s voices. The boys were talking happily in their safe
hiding place. The pirates were listening for some time, and
then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them
and noted the holes in the seven trees.
</p><p>
‘Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?’ Smee
whispered.
</p><p>
Captain Hook stood still for some time thinking. Then
he smiled.
</p><p>
‘Tell me about your plan, captain. What are you going to
do?’ Smee asked.
</p><p>
‘To return to the ship,’ said Captain Hook, ‘and cook a
large rich cake with green sugar on it. There is only one
chimney, so there can be only one room below. But there
are seven doors. That shows they have no mother to tell
them it’s quite enough to have one door for all of them. We
will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids’ Lagoon.
These boys are always swimming there, playing with the
mermaids. They will find the cake and they will eat it at
once. They have no mother, and they don’t know it’s 
dangerous to eat rich cakes. And they will die.’
‘Great plan!’ Smee shouted, and they began to sing a
pirate’s song and dance. But suddenly they stopped. They
heard a distant sound.
</p><p>
Tick tick tick tick!
</p><p>
‘The crocodile!’ Hook whispered and ran away, and
Smee followed him.
</p><p>
It indeed was the crocodile. It was looking for Hook.
</p><p>
Once again the boys came out of their hiding place, and
soon Nibs came running to the meadow. A pack of wolves
pursued him.
</p><p>
‘Save me, save me!’ cried Nibs, falling on the ground.
</p><p>
‘What can we do, what can we do?’
</p><p>
And then they cried, ‘What would Peter do?’
</p><p>
Almost in the same breath they cried, ‘Peter would look
at them through his legs.’
</p><p>
And then, ‘Let’s do what Peter would do.’
</p><p>
It is the best way of defying wolves, so they bent and
looked through their legs, and advanced the wolves, and the
wolves immediately dropped their tails and ran away.
</p><p>
Now Nibs rose from the ground and said:
</p><p>
‘I saw a wonderful thing. It was a great white bird. It is
flying this way.’
</p><p>
‘What kind of a bird, do you think?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t know,’ Nibs said, ‘but it looks very tired, and as it
flies it moans, “Poor Wendy.”’
</p><p>
‘Poor Wendy?’
</p><p>
‘I remember,’ said Slightly immediately, ‘there are birds
called Wendies.’
</p><p>
‘See, here it is!’ cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the sky.
</p><p>
Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear
her crying. But even more clearly they heard the shrill voice 
of Tinker Bell. She was ﬂying around Wendy pinching her 
every time she touched her.
</p><p>
‘Hullo, Tink,’ cried the wondering boys.
</p><p>
‘Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy,’ Tink answered
loudly.
</p><p>
The boys never asked questions when Peter gave orders.
‘Let us do what Peter wishes!’ they cried. ‘Quick, bows and
arrows!
</p><p>
But their bows and arrows were in their hiding place,
and they hurried to their trees and down to get them. Only
Tootles had a bow and arrows with him, and Tink saw it.
</p><p>
‘Quick, Tootles, quick,’ she shouted. ‘Peter will be happy.’
</p><p>
Tootles hurriedly fitted the arrow to his bow. ‘Out of the
way, Tink,’ he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fell to
the ground with an arrow in her breast.
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 6</span> The Little House</h3>
<div>


<p>
When the other boys came with their bows and arrows,
Tootles was standing proudly over Wendy’s
body
</p><p>
‘You are too late,’ he cried proudly, ‘I shot the Wendy.
Peter will like it very much.’
</p><p>
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ‘You fool!’ and hurried to
a hiding place.
</p><p>
The others did not hear her. They gathered around Wen-
dy, and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood.
Slightly was the first to speak. ‘This is not a bird,’ he said
with fear in his voice. ‘I think this must be a lady.’
</p><p>
‘A lady?’ said Tootles and fell to the ground.
</p><p>
‘And we killed her,’ Nibs said. They took off their caps.
</p><p>
‘Now I see,’ Curly said. ‘Peter was bringing her to us.’ He
threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.
</p><p>
‘The lady to take care of us at last,’ said one of the Twins.
‘And you killed her.’
</p><p>
They were sorry for Tootles, but they were sorrier for
themselves.
</p><p>
‘I did it,’ said Tootles. ‘When ladies come to me in my
dreams, I say, “Pretty mother, pretty mother.” But when at
last she really came, I shot her.’
</p><p>
He moved slowly away.
</p><p>
‘Don’t go,’ they called in pity.
</p><p>
‘I must,’ he answered. ‘I am so afraid of Peter.’
</p><p>
And at this tragic moment they heard a sound which made
the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard
Peter crow. It was his way to tell them, ‘I’m coming back!’
</p><p>
‘Peter!’ they cried.
</p><p>
‘Hide her,’ they whispered, and gathered hastily around
Wendy, all but Tootles.
</p><p>
‘Hello, boys,’ said Peter, and mechanically they saluted,
and then again was silence. Peter didn’t like it.
</p><p>
‘I am back,’ he said, ‘why do you not cheer?’
</p><p>
They opened their mouths, but the cheers did not come.
</p><p>
‘Great news, boys,’ Peter cried, ‘I brought a mother for
you all.’
</p><p>
Still no sound, only Tootles dropped on his knees.
</p><p>
‘Did you see her?’ asked Peter, becoming troubled. ‘She
flew this way.’
Tootles rose. ‘Peter,’ he said quietly, ‘I will show her to
you. Back, Twins, let Peter see.’
</p><p>
So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he was
looking for a while he did not know what to do next.
</p><p>
‘She is dead,’ he said.
</p><p>
But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and
faced his band.
</p><p>
‘Whose arrow?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘Mine, Peter,’ said Tootles on his knees.
</p><p>
Peter raised the arrow to use it as a knife.
</p><p>
Tootles didn’t move. ‘Strike, Peter,’ he said firmly.
</p><p>
Twice Peter raised the arrow, and twice his hand fell.
‘I cannot strike,’ he said, ‘something stops my hand.’
</p><p>
All looked at him in wonder, except Nibs. Luckily, he
looked at Wendy.
</p><p>
‘It is she,’ he cried, ‘the Wendy lady, see, her arm!’
</p><p>
It was true. Wendy really raised her arm. Nibs bent over
her and listened carefully. ‘I think she said, “Poor Tootles,”’
he whispered.
</p><p>
‘She lives,’ Peter said.
</p><p>
Slightly cried, ‘The Wendy lady lives.’
</p><p>
Peter fell on his knees beside her and found his button.
It was hanging on a chain she wore round her neck.
</p><p>
‘See,’ he said, ‘the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss
I gave her. It saved her life.’
</p><p>
‘I remember kisses,’ Slightly said quickly, ‘let me see it.
Oh yes, that’s a kiss.’
</p><p>
Peter did not hear him.
</p><p>
‘Get better quickly, Wendy!’ he said. ‘Get better quickly,
and I will show you the mermaids.’
</p><p>
Wendy was too weak to answer him. But there came a
sound of crying from overhead.
‘Listen to Tink,’ said Curly, ‘she is crying because lady
Wendy lives.’
</p><p>
Then they told Peter of Tink’s crime. And he became angrier than ever.
</p><p>
‘Listen, Tinker Bell,’ he cried, ‘I am not your friend any
more. Go away from me forever!’
</p><p>
She ﬂew on to his shoulder and asked him to change his
mind, but he brushed her off. And only when Wendy raised
her arm again he said, ‘Well, not forever, but for a whole week.’
</p><p>
Do you think Tinker Bell was thankful to Wendy for 
raising her arm? Oh no! She wanted to pinch her more than
ever! Fairies indeed are strange.
</p><p>
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state
of health?
</p><p>
‘Let us carry her down into the house,’ Curly said.
</p><p>
‘Oh yes,’ Slightly agreed, ‘that is what one does with
ladies.’
</p><p>
‘No, no,’ Peter said, ‘you must not touch her. It is not
quite respectful.’
</p><p>
‘That,’ said Slightly, ‘is what I was thinking.’
</p><p>
‘But she can’t lie here,’ Tootles said, ‘she will die.’
</p><p>
‘Oh yes, she will die,’ Slightly agreed, ‘but what can we do?’
</p><p>
‘Let’s build a little house round her,’ cried Peter.
</p><p>
They were all in delight. ‘Quick,’ he ordered them, ‘bring
me each of you the best of what we have. Be sharp.’
</p><p>
The work started immediately. And while they were
busy, John and Michael appeared. They were walking
slowly, and kept falling asleep, stopping, waking up, moving
another step and falling asleep again.
</p><p>
‘]ohn, Iohn, wake up’, cried Michael. ‘Where is Nana,
Iohn, where is our mother?’
‘It is true, we were flying,’ ]ohn answered, rubbing his
eyes.
</p><p>
They were very happy to find Peter.
</p><p>
‘Hello, Peter’, they said.
</p><p>
‘Hello’, answered Peter. He didn’t remember them quite
well at the moment because he was too busy.
</p><p>
‘Is Wendy asleep?’ they asked.
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘]ohn,’ Michael said, ‘let’s wake her and get her to make
supper for us,’ but as soon as he said it some of the other
boys came running with branches for the building of the
house. ‘Look at them!’ he cried.
</p><p>
‘Curly,’ said Peter, ‘see that these boys help in the building of the house.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, sir.’
</p><p>
‘Build a house?’ exclaimed ]ohn.
</p><p>
‘For Wendy,’ said Curly.
</p><p>
‘For Wendy?’ ]ohn asked. ‘But she is only a girl!’
</p><p>
‘That,’ explained Curly, ‘is why we are her servants.’
</p><p>
‘You? Wendy’s servants!’
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ said Peter, ‘and you also.’
</p><p>
And John and Michael joined the other boys.
</p><p>
Peter thought of everything. ‘Slightly,’ he cried, ‘bring a
doctor.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, sir,’ said Slightly at once, and disappeared. He returned in a moment, wearing ]ohn’s hat and looking very
serious.
</p><p>
‘Please, sir,’ said Peter, going to him, ‘are you a doctor?’
</p><p>
The difference between him and the other boys was that
they knew when it was make-believe, and to him make-
believe and true were exactly the same thing. So they had
to keep pretending.
‘Yes, my little man,’ Slightly answered.
</p><p>
‘Please, sir,’ Peter explained, ‘a lady lies very ill.’
</p><p>
She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not
to see her.
</p><p>
‘Tut, tut, tut,’ he said, ‘Where is she?’
</p><p>
‘Right here, sir.’
</p><p>
‘I will put a glass thing in her mouth,’ said Slightly, and
he pretended to do it, while Peter waited.
</p><p>
‘How is she?’ asked Peter.
</p><p>
‘Tut, tut, tut,’ said Slightly. ‘This cured her.’
</p><p>
‘I am glad!’ Peter cried.
</p><p>
‘I will call again in the evening,’ Slightly said; ‘give her
beef tea out of a cup.’
</p><p>
Then he returned the hat to John and looked very happy.
</p><p>
The boys gathered all the things they needed for a house
and paused.
</p><p>
‘We don’t know what kind of houses she likes,’ one of
them said.
</p><p>
‘Peter,’ shouted another, ‘she is moving in her sleep.’
</p><p>
‘Her mouth opens,’ cried a third, looking at Wendy. ‘Oh,
lovely!’
</p><p>
‘Maybe she is going to sing in her sleep,’ said Peter. ‘Wendy, sing the kind of house you want to have.’
</p><p>
Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to
sing:
</p><p> </p><p>




	‘I want a pretty house,</p><p>
	The smallest ever seen,</p><p>
	With funny little red walls</p><p>
	And roof of mossy green.’</p><p> </p><p>



They were very glad, because all the branches were red-
dish, and there was plenty of moss around them. </p><p>
They built a house, covered its roof and sang:</p><p> </p><p>



	‘Here are the little walls and roof,</p><p>
	Here is a lovely door,</p><p>

	So tell us, mother Wendy,</p><p>

	Do you want something more?’</p><p> </p><p>



Wendy wanted many windows, and roses around them,
and babies in the house.
</p><p>
They made windows, and large yellow leaves were the
blinds.
</p><p>
‘Roses,’ cried Peter.
</p><p>
Quickly they pretended to grow the loveliest roses up
the walls. And for babies, they offered themselves. Peter
liked the idea and at once pretended that it was his own.
The house was quite beautiful, and they were sure it suited
Wendy. Peter ordered some finishing touches, and now the
house had Iohn’s hat for a chimney.
</p><p>
‘All look your best,’ Peter ordered and knocked at the
door. The boys stood very still. They hoped a lady would
answer the knock.
</p><p>
The door opened, and a lady came out. It was Wendy.
They took off their hats.
</p><p>
Wendy looked at them in surprise. That was exactly the
look they wanted her to have.
</p><p>
‘Where am I?’ she asked.
</p><p>
‘Lady Wendy, we built this house for you’, said Slightly.
</p><p>
‘Say that you like it’, said Nibs.
</p><p>
‘What a lovely house!’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘And we are your children,’ cried the Twins.
</p><p>
Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms
cried, ‘O Wendy lady, be our mother.’
‘Oh,’ Wendy said, all shining. ‘Of course I like the idea
very much, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real
experience.’
</p><p> 
‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Peter, ‘we need just a nice
motherly person.’
</p><p> 
‘Oh!’ Wendy said, ‘you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.’
</p><p> 
‘It is, it is,’ they all cried; ‘we saw it at once.’
</p><p> 
‘Very well,’ she said, ‘I will do my best. Come inside at
once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are wet. And
before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story
of Cinderella.’
</p><p> 
And they went in (you can squeeze very tight in the
Neverland). And that was the first of the many happy
evenings they had with Wendy.
</p><p> 
By and by she put them to their great bed in the home
under the trees. But she herself slept that night in the little
house, and Peter kept watch with his sword. After a time he
fell asleep, and some fairies had to climb over him on their
way home from a party.
</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 7</span> The Home under the Ground</h3>
<div>


<p>
The next morning Peter measured Wendy, John and
Michael for hollow trees. Hook laughed at the boys
for having an entrance for each of them. He didn’t
</p><p>
know it was easy to go up and down if you fitted the tree,
so every boy needed a tree of his own. Wendy and Michael 
fitted their trees at the first try, but Iohn needed some
changes
</p><p>
After a few days’ practice they could go up and down
very quickly. And they grew to love their home under the
ground; especially Wendy. It was rough and simple, and it
consisted of one large room. There was one small recess in
the wall, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.
</p><p>
Wendy was busy all day long. She had to cook (both real
and make-believe meals). Her favourite time for sewing was
after all boys went to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had
some time for herself; and she spent it making new things
for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, because
they kept tearing them.
</p><p>
Her pet wolf very soon found her, and they just ran into
each other’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.
</p><p>
Did she think much about her parents? Well, Wendy
did not really worry about her father and mother; she was
absolutely sure that they would always keep the window
open for her to come back, and it made her quite happy.
What disturbed her at times was the fact that Iohn did not
remember his parents quite well, and Michael was sure that
Wendy was really his mother. These things frightened her
a little. To make them remember their old life she offered
them examination papers, just like the school tests. The
other boys thought this awfully interesting, and they usually joined john and Michael. And they were also writing and
thinking hard about the questions. They were the most ordinary questions — ‘What was the colour of Mother’s eyes?
Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or
brunette? Answer all three questions if possible.’
And it was really dreadful to see the number of questions even ]ohn couldn’t answer. Of course the only boy who
answered every question was Slightly, but his answers were
very funny.
</p><p>
Peter did not take part in it. He despised all mothers except Wendy. And he was also the only boy on the island who
couldn’t write. He was above all that sort of things.
</p><p>
He often went out alone, and when he came back one
couldn’t be sure about his adventures. He could have an adventure, and forget all about it, and say nothing about it.
And when you went out you found the body. Or he could tell
a story about his adventure, but you could not find the body.
</p><p>
But there were many adventures which she knew to be
true because she took part in them. It is very difficult to
describe all of them or to choose one to tell about.
</p><p>
We could tell of that cake the pirates cooked for the boys
to eat and die. They put it in one suitable place or another.
But Wendy always snatched it from the hands of her children.
So in time the cake stopped looking so appetizing and
turned quite hard and dry, and it became a great thing to
throw at someone, and Hook finally fell over it in the dark.
</p><p>
Or we can tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends,
particularly of the Never bird that lived in a tree over the
lagoon, and how its nest fell into the water, and still the
bird sat on her eggs, and Peter ordered not to disturb it.
That is a pretty story, and the end shows how thankful a
bird can be. But then we’ll have to tell the whole adventure
of the lagoon. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting,
was Tinker Bell’s attempt to remove sleeping Wendy on a
great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave
way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam 
back. Or we can choose Peter’s adventure with the lions,
when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an
arrow and dared them to cross it; and he waited for hours,
with the other boys and Wendy looking at him from trees,
but no lion dared to accept his challenge.
</p><p>
Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best
way is to toss for it.
</p><p>
I tossed, and the lagoon won.

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 8</span> The Mermaid’s Lagoon</h3>
<div>


<p>
The children often spent long summer days on the
beautiful Mermaid lagoon, swimming or floating
most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the
</p><p>
water, and so on. Mermaids themselves were not very
friendly with them. ‘Never a polite word from one of them!’
Wendy said sadly. They always dived when she approached
them, and they treated all the boys in the same way, except,
of course, Peter.
</p><p>
They usually came ashore at the turn of the moon, and
their strange cries sounded in the air. But the lagoon was
dangerous for people then. Wendy was often at the lagoon
on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in
extraordinary numbers playing with their bubbles. The
bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat
as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their
tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.
But the moment the children tried to join in they had
to play by themselves, because the mermaids immediately
disappeared. They secretly watched the children, and were
not above taking an idea from them. When John invented a
new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the
hand, the mermaids adopted it.
</p><p>
It was also rather pretty to see the children resting on
a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy al-
ways made them have a rest, and they lay there in the sun,
and Wendy sat beside them and looked important.
</p><p>
It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’
Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed.
The boys were sleeping, or lying with their eyes shut, and
Wendy sat nearby sewing. Suddenly a change came to the
lagoon. The sun went away, and the lagoon looked horrible
and unfriendly. Something dark and terrible was coming.
What was it?
</p><p>
She remembered the horrible stories about the lagoon.
Pirates sometimes took sailors there to put them on
Marooners’ Rock, and when the tide rose, they drowned there.
</p><p>
Wendy thought ofwaking her children. There was more
than one danger. The rock was growing cold, and it was no
longer good for them to sleep on it. But she was a young
mother and she did not know this. She didn’t wake the boys,
even when she heard the sound of oars. Was it not brave of
Wendy?
</p><p>
Fortunately, one of them could smell danger even in his
sleep. Peter jumped up to his feet.
</p><p>
‘Pirates!’ he cried. The others woke up and came closer
to him. A strange smile was playing about his face, and
Wendy saw it and shuddered.
‘Dive!’ Peter shouted.
</p><p>
All of them dived.
</p><p>
The boat drew nearer. It was a pirate boat, with three
figures in herl, Smee and Starkey, and the third one was
Tiger Lily. The pirates caught her when she was coming on
board with a knife in her mouth, and tied her hands and
feet, and decided to leave her on Marooner’s Rock. She
knew why they took her there, but she was calm. She was
the daughter ofa chief so she must die as a chief’s daughter.
</p><p>
It was dark, so the pirates didn’t see the rock and crashed
into it.
</p><p>
‘Here’s the rock,’ said Smee. ‘Let’s put the girl on it, and
leave her here to drown.’
</p><p>
In a moment the girl was on the rock.
</p><p>
Quite near the rock, but out of sight, there were two
heads above the water, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was
crying. It was the first tragedy she saw. And Peter never
remembered the previous tragedies. He was less sorry for
Tiger Lily than Wendy: it was two against one that made
him angry, and he was going to save her. An easy way was to
wait for the pirates to leave. But he didn’t choose easy ways.
</p><p>
He now imitated the voice of Hook.
</p><p>
‘Hey you there!’ he called.
</p><p>
‘The captain!’ said the pirates in surprise. They looked
around but they couldn’t see Hook.
</p><p>
‘We are putting the Indian on the rock,’ Smee called out.
</p><p>
‘Set her free,’ came the answer.
</p><p>
‘Free!’
</p><p>
‘Yes, let her go.’
</p><p>
‘But, captain — ’
</p><p>
‘Now!’ cried Peter.
</p><p>
‘This is very strange!’ Smee said.
</p><p>
‘Better do what the captain says,’ said Starkey nervously.
</p><p>
‘Yes, sir!’ Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s ropes. Tiger
Lily immediately dived into the water.
</p><p>
At this moment they heard a shout:
</p><p>
‘Hey, you, in the boat!’
</p><p>
The real Hook was also in the water. He was swimming
to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he
reached them soon. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw
his hook grip the boat’s side; she saw his cruel face as he
rose from the water. She wanted to swim away, but Peter
was going to stay.
</p><p>
‘I’m a wonder, oh, really, I’m a wonder, aren’t I?’ he whispered
to her. Wendy quite agreed, but she was really glad
that no one heard him except herself.
</p><p>
He signed to her to listen.
</p><p>
‘Captain, is all well?’ the pirates asked.
</p><p>
‘We have a problem,’ he cried, ‘Now the boys have a
mother.’
</p><p>
Wendy was very proud.
</p><p>
‘O evil day!’ cried Starkey.
</p><p>
‘What’s a mother?’ asked the ignorant Smee.
</p><p>
Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed:
</p><p>
‘He doesn’t know!’
</p><p>
Peter pulled her under the water, because Hook started
up, crying, ‘What was that?’
</p><p>
‘I heard nothing,’ said Starkey, raising the lantern over
the waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight.
 It was a nest, ﬂoating on the lagoon, and the Never
bird was sitting on it
‘See,’ said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, ‘that is a
mother. What a lesson! The nest fell into the water, I think.
But the mother can’t leave her eggs.’
</p><p>
There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he 
recalled innocent days when — but it was only for a moment.
</p><p>
Smee, much impressed, looked at the bird, but the more
suspicious Starkey said:
</p><p>
‘If she is a mother, maybe she is here to help Peter.’
</p><p>
‘Maybe,’ said Hook.
</p><p>
‘Captain,’ said Smee, ‘we can kidnap these boys’ mother
and make her our mother, can’t we?’
</p><p>
‘It’s a good idea,’ cried Hook, and at once it took practical
shape in his great brain. ‘We will catch the children and 
carry them to the ship: we will make the boys walk the plank,
and Wendy will be our mother.’
</p><p>
Again Wendy forgot herself.
</p><p>
‘Never!’ she cried.
</p><p>
‘What was that?’
</p><p>
But the pirates didn’t see anything suspicious.
</p><p>
‘Do you agree?’ asked Hook.
</p><p>
They all agreed. By this time they were on the rock, and
suddenly Hook remembered Tiger Lily.
</p><p>
‘Where is the Indian girl?’ he asked.
</p><p>
Sometimes he liked a good joke, and they thought this
was one of such moments.
‘That is all right, captain,’ Smee answered; ‘we let her go.’
</p><p>
‘Let her go!’ cried Hook.
</p><p>
‘You said so,’ said Smee.
</p><p>
‘You called over the water to us and said, “Let her go,”’
said Starkey.
</p><p>
‘What is going on here?’ exclaimed the Captain. His face
turned black with anger, but he saw that they really be-
lieved their words. That was quite frightening.
</p><p>
‘I didn’t say anything like that.’
</p><p>
‘It is strange,’ Smee said.
</p><p>
Hook raised his trembling voice.
</p><p>
‘The spirit of this dark lagoon! Do you hear me?’ cried
Hook.
</p><p>
Of course Peter could not keep silent. He immediately
answered in Hook’s voice:
</p><p>
‘I hear you!’
</p><p>
‘Who are you, stranger? Speak!’ Hook said.
</p><p>
‘I am Iames Hook,’ replied the voice, ‘captain of the “Jolly
Roger”.’
</p><p>
‘You are not; you are not,’ Hook cried.
</p><p>
‘Don’t you say it!’ the voice answered.
</p><p>
‘So you’re Hook,’ the captain said almost humbly. ‘Who
am I, then?’
</p><p>
‘A codfish,’ replied the voice, ‘only a codfish.’
</p><p>
‘A codfish!’ Hook echoed helplessly, and it was then, but
not till then, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men
draw back from him.
</p><p>
‘To have a codfish for a captain!’ the pirates said.
</p><p>
But he didn’t care. He felt his ego leaving him. ‘Don’t
leave me,’ he whispered.
</p><p>
Suddenly he had an idea. He tried a guessing game.
‘Hook,’ he called, ‘do you have another voice?’
Peter was always ready for a game, and he answered in
his own voice, ‘I do.’</p><p>
‘And another name?’</p><p>
‘That’s right.’</p><p>
‘Vegetable?’ asked Hook.</p><p>
‘No.’</p><p>
‘Mineral?’</p><p>
‘No.’</p><p>
‘Animal?’</p><p>
‘Yes.’</p><p>
‘Man?’</p><p>
‘No!’</p><p>
‘Boy?’</p><p>
‘Yes.’</p><p>
‘Ordinary boy?’</p><p>
‘No!’</p><p>
‘Wonderful boy?’</p><p>
‘Yes.’</p><p>
‘Are you in England?’</p><p>
‘No.</p><p>
‘Are you here?’</p><p>
‘Yes.’</p><p>
Hook was completely puzzled. ‘Now you ask him some
questions,’ he said to the others.</p><p>
Smee thought for a little. ‘I can’t think of a thing,’ he said sadly.</p><p>
‘Can’t guess, can’t guess!’ crowed Peter. ‘Do you give it up?’
</p><p>
The pirates saw their chance.
</p><p>
‘Yes, yes,’ they answered eagerly.
</p><p>
‘Well, then,’ he cried, ‘I am Peter Pan.’
</p><p>
Pan!
</p><p>
In a moment Hook was himself again.
</p><p>
‘Now we have him,’ Hook shouted. ‘Into the water, Smee.
Starkey, look after the boat. Take him dead or alive!’
</p><p>
‘Are you ready, boys?’ cried Peter.
</p><p>
‘Yes!’ the answer came from all over the lagoon.
</p><p>
John was the first one to show his courage. He attacked
Starkey and tore the cutlass from his hand. Starkey
fell overboard, ]ohn followed him, and the boat drifted
away.
</p><p>
The battle was terrible. Peter was looking for Captain
Hook.
</p><p>
Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook
rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter
climbed it on the opposite side. Neither knew that the other
was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other’s arm: in
surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost
touching; so they met.
</p><p>
Peter snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and was about
to stab him, when he saw that he was higher up the rock
than his enemy. It wasn’t fair. He gave the pirate a hand to
help him up.
</p><p>
And Hook bit him.
</p><p>
It was unfair. Not the pain but the unfairness of it made
Peter helpless. He could just stare at Hook in horror. Every
child does the same thing the first time someone treats him
unfairly. And a child is not quite the same after the first unfairness.
 No one gets over the first unfairness — no one except
 Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot it. So when
he met it now it was like the first time. And he could only
stare helplessly. Twice the iron hook clawed him.
A moment later the boys saw Hook swimming away for
the ship. There was fear on his face, and he was in a hurry,
because the crocodile was following him. The boys didn’t
follow them because they couldn’t find Peter and Wendy.
They found the boat and went home in it, shouting ‘Peter!
Wendy!’ No answer came. But the boys were sure there
was nothing to worry about. ‘They are swimming back, or
ﬂying,’ they said, ‘and we will be late for bed, and it’s all
mother Wendy’s fault!’
</p><p>
When their voices died away there came cold silence
over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry.
</p><p>
‘Help, help!’
</p><p>
There were two small figures near the rock. The girl lay
on the boy’s arm in a faint. With a last effort Peter pulled her
up the rock and then lay down beside her. He saw that the
water was rising. He knew that they were going to drown,
but he could do no more.
</p><p>
As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the
feet, and began pulling her softly into the water. Peter woke
up and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell
her the truth.
</p><p>
‘We are on the rock, Wendy,’ he said, ‘but it is growing
smaller. Soon the water will be over it.’
</p><p>
She did not understand.
</p><p>
‘We must go,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ he answered.
</p><p>
‘Shall we swim or ﬂy, Peter?’
‘Do you think you could swim or ﬂy as far as the island,
Wendy, without my help?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t think so, Peter. I’m too tired.’
</p><p>
He moaned.
</p><p>
‘What is it?’ she asked, anxious about him at once.
</p><p>
‘I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can
neither ﬂy nor swim.’
</p><p>
‘Do you mean we are going to drown?’
</p><p>
‘Look how the water is rising.’
</p><p>
They put their hands over their eyes not to see this 
terrible sight. Suddenly something touched Peter, as if asking:
‘Can I help you?’ It was the tail Michael’s kite.
</p><p>
‘Michael’s kite,’ Peter said without interest, but next 
moment he gripped the tail, and was pulling the kite toward
him.
</p><p>
‘It lifted Michael off the ground,’ he cried; ‘why should it
not carry you?’
</p><p>
‘Both of us!’
</p><p>
‘It can’t lift two, Michael and Curly tried.’
</p><p>
‘Let us draw lots,’ Wendy said bravely.
</p><p>
‘And you are a lady; never.’ He was tying the tail round
her. But Wendy refused to go without him; but with a
‘Good-bye, Wendy,’ he pushed her from the rock; and in a
few minutes she was out of sight. Peter was alone on the
lagoon.
</p><p>
The rock was very small now; soon it will be under the
water.
</p><p>
Peter was not quite like the other boys; but he was afraid
at last. He shuddered, but the next moment he was standing
on the rock with the smile on his face. It was saying:
</p><p>
‘To die will be an awfully big adventure.’
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 9</span> The Never Bird</h3>
<div>	
	
<p>
The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone
was the mermaids’ diving into the water, as they
were returning to their bedrooms under the sea. He
</p><p>
was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in
the coral caves where they live rings a small bell when it
opens or closes, and he heard the bells.
</p><p>
Water rose, and to pass the time, Peter watched the only
thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of ﬂoating
paper. Soon he said to himself, ‘That piece of paper
has some definite purpose! It is fighting the tide, and
sometimes winning!’
</p><p>
It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird,
and it was doing her best to reach Peter on the nest. She
was there to save him and give him her nest, though there
were eggs in it.
</p><p>
‘I came here to save you!’ she called out to him.
</p><p>
‘What are you doing here?’ Pater called out to her.
</p><p>
In fairy tales people can talk to the birds. But truth is best,
and I want to tell you only what really happened. They could
not understand each other, and soon they forgot their manners.
</p><p>
‘I — want — you — to — get — into — the — nest,’ the
bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,
‘and — then — you — can — drift— ashore, but— I—
am — too — tired — to — bring — it — any — nearer —
so — you — must — try — to — swim — to — it.’
</p><p>
‘What do you want?’ Peter answered. ‘Why don’t you let
the nest drift as usual?’
‘I — want — you — ’ the bird repeated it all over.
</p><p>
Then Peter tried to speak slowly and distinctly.
</p><p>
‘What — do — you — want?’ and so on.
</p><p>
Finally the Never bird became angry with him.
</p><p>
‘You fool! Why don’t you do as I tell you?’
</p><p>
A short quarrel followed. But the bird was going to save
him, and by one last effort she pushed the nest to the rock.
Then she ﬂew up, leaving her eggs in the nest.
</p><p>
Then at last he understood, and gripped the nest and
waved his thanks to the bird. The Never bird didn’t ﬂy away.
She was there to see what he did with her eggs.
</p><p>
There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them
up. The bird covered her face with her wings, but she could
not help peeping between the feathers.
</p><p>
Starkey’s hat was still on the rock. It was a good 
watertight hat with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into this hat
and set it on the lagoon. It ﬂoated beautifully.
</p><p>
The Never bird gave a cry of admiration of him; and Peter
crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest and
hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird sat on
her eggs. So they parted, very happy with each other.
</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 10</span> The Happy Home</h3>
<div>


<p>
This adventure made the Indians their friends. All
 night and day they sat above, keeping watch over the
home under the ground and waiting for the big attack 
by the pirates.</p><p>
I’m going to tell you about the evening that is now called
the Night of Nights, because of its adventures.The day was
just an ordinary one, and now the Indians in their blankets
were at their posts above, while, below, the children were
having their evening meal; all except Peter, who was out to
get the time. The way to know the time on the island was to
find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
</p><p>
It was a make-believe tea, and the boys kept complaining
of each other’s behaviour at table. They were speaking
all at once.
</p><p>
‘Silence,’ cried Wendy. ‘Is your cup empty, Slightly darling?’
</p><p>
‘Not quite empty, mummy,’ Slightly said, after looking
into his make-believe cup.
</p><p>
‘He doesn’t drink his milk,’ Nibs said.
</p><p>
‘I complain of Nibs,’ Slightly cried.
</p><p>
But John held up his hand first.
</p><p>
‘Well, Iohn?’
</p><p>
‘May I sit in Peter’s chair? He is not here.’
</p><p>
‘Sit in father’s chair, Iohn!’ Wendy was shocked. ‘Certainly not.’
</p><p>
‘He is not really our father,’ John answered. ‘He didn’t
even know how a father behaves till I showed him.’
</p><p>
‘We complain of Iohn,’ cried the twins.
</p><p>
Tootles held up his hand. ‘I don’t think,’ Tootles said,
‘that I could be father.’
</p><p>
‘No, Tootles.’
</p><p>
‘As I can’t be father,’ he said, ‘I don’t think, Michael, you
can let me be baby?’
</p><p>
‘No, I can’t,’ Michael said. He was already in his basket.
Wendy wanted to have a baby in cradle, so he had to sleep
in a basket hanging from the ceiling.
‘As I can’t be baby,’ Tootles said, ‘do you think I could be
a twin?’
</p><p>
‘No, you can’t,’ answered the twins; ‘it’s very difficult to
be a twin.’
</p><p>
‘So I can’t be anything important,’ said Tootles. ‘Would
any of you like to see me do a trick?’
</p><p>
‘No,’ they all answered.
</p><p>
‘I hadn’t really any hope,’ he said.
</p><p>
The noise started again, and the meal was over, and
Wendy sat down to her work-basket.
</p><p>
‘Wendy,’ said Michael, ‘I’m too big for a cradle.’
</p><p>
‘I must have somebody in a cradle,’ she answered, ‘and
you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to
have about a house.’
</p><p>
While she sewed they played around her, as usual. It was
a very nice scene, but we are looking on it for the last time.
</p><p>
There was a step above, and Wendy said:
</p><p>
‘Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet
him at the door.’
</p><p>
And then, as so often before, the happy children dragged
him from his tree. As so often before, but never again.
</p><p>
He brought nuts for the boys and the correct time for
Wendy.
</p><p>
‘Peter, you just spoil them, you know,’ Wendy said smiling.
</p><p>
‘Easy, old lady,’ said Peter, hanging up his weapons.
</p><p>
The first twin came to Peter. ‘Father, we want to dance.’
</p><p>
‘Dance, then, my little man,’ said Peter, who was in high
good humour.
</p><p>
‘But we want you to dance.’
</p><p>
Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he
pretended to be shocked.
</p><p>
‘Me! My old bones will rattle!’</p><p>
‘And mummy too.’
</p><p>
‘What?’ cried Wendy.
</p><p>
‘But on a Saturday night,’ Slightly said.
</p><p>
It was not really Saturday night; but it was always Saturday night when they wanted something special.
</p><p>
‘Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘People of our figure, Wendy!’
</p><p>
‘But it is only among our own children.’
</p><p>
‘True, true.’
</p><p>
Then they were sitting by the fire, and Wendy said:
</p><p>
‘Dear Peter, with such a large family, of course, I am not
like I was before. But you don’t want to exchange me, do you?’
</p><p>
‘No, Wendy.’
</p><p>
Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her
uncomfortably.
</p><p>
‘Peter, what is it?’
</p><p>
‘I was just thinking,’ he said. ‘It is only make-believe, isn’t
it, that I am their father?’
</p><p>
‘Oh yes,’ Wendy said coldly.
</p><p>
‘You see,’ he continued, ‘it would make me seem so old
to be their real father.’
</p><p>
‘But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.’
</p><p>
‘But not really, Wendy?’ he asked anxiously.
</p><p>
‘Not if you don’t wish it. Peter,’ she asked, trying to speak
firmly, ‘what are your exact feelings to me?’
</p><p>
‘As a devoted son, Wendy.’
</p><p>
‘I thought so,’ she said, and went and sat by herself at the
far end of the room.
</p><p>
‘You are so strange,’ he said, ‘and Tiger Lily is just the
same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she
says it is not my mother.’
‘No, indeed, it is not,’ Wendy answered coldly. She didn’t
like Tiger Lily and her Indians being close to the house. And
now we know why.
</p><p>
‘Then what is it?’
</p><p>
‘It isn’t for a lady to tell.’
</p><p>
‘Oh, very well,’ Peter said, a little hurt. ‘Perhaps Tinker
Bell will tell me.’
</p><p>
‘Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?’ Peter asked.
</p><p>
‘You fool!’ cried Tinker Bell angrily.
</p><p>
‘I almost agree with her,’ Wendy said. Tink used the
phrase so often that Wendy needed no translation.
</p><p>
Wendy didn’t know that it was their last evening in their
home under the ground. That’s why she said it.
</p><p>
They didn’t know it was their last hour on the island. Their
ignorance gave them one more glad hour. And they danced, and
had a pillow fight, and they were telling stories, and then at
last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story they loved
best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this
story he left the room or put his hands over his ears. But tonight he stayed on his chair; and we can see what happened.
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 11</span> Wendy’s Story</h3>
<div>


<p>
‘listen, then,’ said Wendy to the boys. ‘There was once a gentleman — ’</p><p>
‘Why not a lady?’ Curly said.</p><p>
‘Why not a white rat?’ said Nibs.</p><p>
‘Quiet,’ Wendy said. ‘There was a lady also.’</p><p>
‘Oh, mummy,’ cried the first twin, ‘you mean that there is
a lady also, don’t you? She is not dead, is she?’</p><p>
‘Oh, no.’</p><p>
‘I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,’ said Tootles. ‘Are you
glad, Iohn?’</p><p>
‘Of course I am.’</p><p>
‘Are you glad, Nibs?’</p><p>
‘Yes!’</p><p>
‘Are you glad, Twins?’</p><p>
‘We are glad.’</p><p>

Wendy sighed.</p><p>

‘Be quiet!’ Peter said.
</p><p>
‘The gentleman’s name,’ Wendy continued, ‘was Mr. Darling, and the lady’s name was Mrs. Darling.’
</p><p>
‘I knew them,’ John said to annoy the others.
</p><p>
‘I think I knew them,’ said Michael, but he wasn’t
sure.
</p><p>
‘They were married, you know,’ explained Wendy, ‘and
what do you think they had?’
</p><p>
‘White rats,’ cried Nibs.
</p><p>
‘No.’
</p><p>
‘That’s a question,’ said Tootles, who knew the story by
heart.
</p><p>
‘Quiet, Tootles. They had three children. And these three
children had a nurse Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with
her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children
ﬂew away.’
</p><p>
‘It’s a very good story,’ said Nibs.
</p><p>
‘They ﬂew away,’ Wendy continued, ‘to the Neverland,
where the lost children are.’
</p><p>
‘I just thought they did,’ Curly exclaimed. ‘I don’t know
how it is, but I just thought they did!’
‘O Wendy,’ cried Tootles, ‘was one of the lost children
called Tootles?’
</p><p>
‘Yes, he was.’
</p><p>
‘I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.’
</p><p>
‘Hush. Now I want you to think of the feelings of their
unhappy parents.’
</p><p>
‘Oo!’ they all moaned. But they were not really thinking
of them.
</p><p>
‘Think of the empty beds!’
</p><p>
‘Oo!’
</p><p>
‘It’s sad,’ the first twin said cheerfully.
</p><p>
‘I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,’ said the
second twin. ‘Do you, Nibs?’
</p><p>
‘I’m very anxious.’
</p><p>
‘You just don’t know how great a mother’s love is,’ Wendy told them triumphantly, ‘that’s why you don’t know there
is no need to be afraid.’
</p><p>
Peter hated this part of the story.
</p><p>
‘I like a mother’s love,’ said Tootles, hitting Nibs with
a pillow. ‘Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?’
</p><p>
‘I do,’ said Nibs, hitting back.
</p><p>
‘You see,’ Wendy said, ‘our heroine knew that the
mother always leaves the window open for her children to
fly back by; so they stayed away for years and had a lovely
time.’
</p><p>
‘Did they ever go back?’

‘Let’s have a look at the future,’ Wendy said. ‘Who is this
elegant lady of uncertain age at London Station?’
</p><p>
‘O Wendy, who is she?’ cried Nibs.
</p><p>
‘Can it be — yes — no — it is — the fair Wendy!’
‘And who are the two noble figures with her? Can they
be John and Michael? They are!’
</p><p>
‘Oh!’
</p><p>
“‘See, dear brothers,” says Wendy, “there is the window
still standing open.” So they ﬂew up to their mummy and
daddy, and all of them were very happy.’
</p><p>
That was the story, and they all liked it as much as Wen-
dy herself. Everything is just as it should be, you see. Children are heartless creatures, and they leave for a selfish
time and return sure that a reward is waiting for them, not
a punishment.
</p><p>
So great was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt
they could be heartless for a bit longer.
</p><p>
But there was one who knew better, and when Wendy
finished he moaned.
</p><p>
‘What is it, Peter?’ she cried, running to him, thinking he
was ill. ‘Where does it hurt, Peter?’
</p><p>
‘It isn’t that kind of pain,’ Peter answered darkly.
</p><p>
‘Then what kind is it?’
</p><p>
‘Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.’
</p><p>
They all gathered round him, frightened, and Peter told
them his story.
</p><p>
‘Long ago,’ he said, ‘I thought like you that my mother
could always keep the window open for me, so I stayed
away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back;
but I found the window closed, and there was another little
boy sleeping in my bed.’
</p><p>
I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was
true; and it frightened them.
</p><p>
‘Are you sure mothers are like that?’
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
So this was the truth about mothers.
</p><p>
‘Wendy, let’s go home,’ cried John and Michael together.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘Not tonight?’ asked the lost boys. They knew a person
can get on quite well without a mother. Only mothers think
one can’t.
</p><p>
‘At once,’ Wendy answered, ‘I think our mother is very
unhappy now.’
</p><p>
She was very anxious. It made her forget about Peter’s
feelings, and she said to him rather sharply, ‘Peter, will you
make the necessary arrangements?’
</p><p>
‘Ifyou wish it,’ he answered, as if she asked him to pass
the nuts.
</p><p>
She didn’t mind parting, did she? Then he, Peter Pan,
was not going to show her that he did. But of course he
cared very much.
</p><p>
He gave instructions to the Indians and came back home.
The boys were in panic. The idea of losing Wendy horrified
them.
</p><p>
‘It will be worse than before she came,’ they cried.
</p><p>
‘We won’t let her go.’
</p><p>
‘Let’s keep her prisoner.’
</p><p>
‘Chain her up.’
</p><p>
An instinct told her to which of them to turn.
</p><p>
‘Tootles,’ she cried, ‘will you help me?’
</p><p>
‘I am just Tootles,’ he said, ‘and nobody cares about me!
But I will fight the first one who does not behave to Wendy
like an English gentleman.’
Then Peter returned, and the boys saw at once that
he wouldn’t help them. He wouldn’t keep any girl in the
Neverland against her will.
</p><p>
‘Wendy,’ he said, ‘The Indians will guide you through the
wood. I told them so.’
</p><p>
‘Thank you, Peter.’
</p><p>
‘Then,’ he continued, ‘Tinker Bell will take you across
the sea. Wake her, Nibs.’
</p><p>
Nibs knocked twice before he got an answer, though
Tink was sitting up in bed listening for some time.
</p><p>
‘Who are you? How dare you? Go away,’ she cried.
</p><p>
‘Get up, Tink,’ Nibs said, ‘and take Wendy on a journey.’
</p><p>
Of course Tink was happy to hear that Wendy was going
away. But she was not going to help her.
</p><p>
‘I won’t! Go away!’
</p><p>
‘Get up, Tink, or I’ll open the curtain and we will see
you in your night gown,’ Peter said. And Tink immediately
got up.
</p><p>
The boys looked sad and unhappy.
</p><p>
‘Children,’ Wendy said, ‘come with me. I’m sure my
father and mother will adopt you.’
</p><p>
The invitation was made especially for Peter, but each
of the boys was thinking of themselves, and at once they
jumped with joy.
</p><p>
‘Peter, can we go?’ the boys cried.
</p><p>
‘All right,’ Peter answered with a smile, and immediately
they rushed to get their things.
</p><p>
‘And now, Peter,’ Wendy said, ‘I am going to give you
your medicine before we go.’ And she took the bottle with
the medicine. He didn’t move. ‘Get your things, Peter,’ she
cried.</p><p>
‘No,’ he answered, pretending indifference, ‘I am not go-
ing with you, Wendy.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, Peter.’
</p><p>
‘No.’
</p><p>
‘We will find your mother,’ she said.
</p><p>
But Peter could do very well without a mother.
</p><p>
‘No, no,’ he told Wendy, ‘she will want me to grow up, but
I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.’
</p><p>
‘But, Peter — ’
</p><p>
‘No.’
</p><p>
‘Peter isn’t coming,’ Wendy said to the boys.
</p><p>
Peter is not coming! All the boys looked at him. ‘He won’t
let us go, then,’ they thought.
</p><p>
But he was too proud for that. ‘I hope you will like your
mothers,’ he said. ‘Good-bye, Wendy.’ And he held out his
hand. It seemed he wanted them to go because he had
something important to do.
</p><p>
She had to take his hand. ‘Will you remember to take
your medicine, Peter?’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
There was an awkward pause. Peter was not going to
show his feelings.
</p><p>
‘Are you ready, Tinker Bell?’ he called out.
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘Then lead the way.’
</p><p>
Tink ﬂew up the nearest tree; but no one followed her,
because at this moment the pirates made their terrible 
attack upon the Indians. Everybody was looking at Peter, 
asking mutely not to leave them. Peter grabbed his sword. He
was ready for battle.
</p>
</div>

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 12</span> The Children Become Prisoners</h3>
<div>


<p>
The pirate attack was a complete surprise. There were
unwritten laws of savage war. The Indians always attacked
the enemies, and they usually did it at dawn.
</p><p>
The Indians knew the pirates were near, and they were
waiting for dawn to attack them. But the pirates attacked
them instead.
</p><p>
The battle was terrible. But Hook was not going to destroy the Indians. He wanted to get Peter Pan, and Wendy,
and Peter’s band, but chiefly Pan.
</p><p>
Why did a man hate such a small boy as Peter? It wasn’t
because of his arm, and it wasn’t because of the crocodile.
There was something about Peter which made the pirate
captain mad. It was not his courage; it was his cockiness.
While Peter lived, Hook felt that he was a lion in a cage with
a sparrow.
</p><p>
Hook was thinking hard how to get down the trees and
in the home underground. The boys below were listening to
the silence that came after the battle. Their fate depended
on the result.
</p><p>
‘Who won, Peter?’ they asked.
</p><p>
‘The Indians always beat their tom-tom when they win,’
Peter answered.
</p><p>
The pirates were standing near the trees. They heard
the questions, and they heard Peter’s answer. Smee was 
sitting on the tom-tom. ‘You will never hear the tom-tom
again,’ he muttered.
‘Beat the tom-tom,’ Hook said. Smee slowly understood
the wickedness of his plan and admired his captain.
</p><p>
Twice Smee beat upon the tom-tom, and then stopped
to listen.
</p><p>
‘The tom-tom,’ Peter cried, ‘the Indians won!’
</p><p>
The doomed children cheered happily, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This puzzled
 the pirates, but they were happy that the boys were
about to come up the trees.
</p><p>
‘One man to each tree, and the others form in a line two
yards apart,’ Hook said.
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 13</span> Do You Believe In Fairies?</h3>
<div>


<p>
Curly was the first to rise out of his tree into the arms
of Cecco, who threw him to Smee, who threw him to
Starkey, who threw him to Bill Iukes, who threw him
to Noodler, and so on. The same happened to the other
boys.</p><p>
Wendy came last. With ironical politeness Hook raised
his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, led her to the
others. His manners fascinated her, and she didn’t even cry.
She was only a little girl.</p><p>
The pirates gagged the boys and started tying them. They
took a rope, and cut it into nine equal parts, and began to tie
the boys. All went well until Slightly’s turn came. It turned
out that there wasn’t enough rope to make a knot. The
pirates grew angry — all except Hook. He was happy. Now
he knew Slightly’s secret. His was bigger than the other
boys, and the hole in his tree was big enough for a man.
Instead of making himself small enough to fit the tree,
Slightly kept making the tree hole big enough for him.
Hook saw it at once. Home under the ground could not
protect Peter any more.
</p><p>
But Hook said nothing about that.
</p><p>
‘Take the prisoners to the ship!’ he said.
</p><p>
Do you remember Wendy’s little house with red walls
and a mossy roof? The pirates put the children inside, and
took the house, and brought it away, singing their horrible
pirate song.
</p><p>
When they left, Hook tiptoed to Slightly’s tree, and made
sure the hole was big enough for him. There he stood motionless, listening carefully and thinking it over. Was that
boy asleep, or was he standing there with his sword waiting
for him?
</p><p>
The only way to know it was to go down. Hook left his
cloak on the ground, and then, biting his lips, he stepped
into the tree. He was a brave man, but he was nervous.
</p><p>
He came down easily, and he immediately saw the great
bed. On the bed Peter lay asleep. He lay in front of Hook,
defenseless, looking cocky even in his sleep.
</p><p>
Hook was happy, but soon he found out that he couldn’t
reach Peter. The door to Slightly’s tree blocked his way. Will
his enemy escape him after all?
Then he saw the cup with Peter’s medicine. He could
reach it easily. And he grew cheerful once again.
</p><p>
Hook always carried about his person a small bottle of
poison. Five drops ofthis he now added to Peter’s cup. Then
he looked at Peter and got out of the house, and walked
away, muttering to himself.
</p><p>
Peter slept on. Then he suddenly sat up in his bed. He
heard a soft knocking at the door of his tree.
</p><p>
Peter gripped his dagger. Then he spoke.
</p><p>
‘Who is that?’
</p><p>
There was no answer; then again came the knock.
</p><p>
‘Who are you?’
</p><p>
No answer.
</p><p>
‘I won’t open unless you speak,’ Peter cried.
</p><p>
Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like
voice.
</p><p>
‘Let me in, Peter.’
</p><p>
It was Tink, and he quickly let her in. She ﬂew into the
room. Her face was red, her dress was dirty.
</p><p>
‘What is it?’
</p><p>
‘Oh, you could never guess!’ she cried, and offered him
three guesses.
</p><p>
‘Tell me!’ Peter cried.
</p><p>
‘The pirates attacked Wendy and all the boys and took
them prisoners!’
</p><p>
‘I’ll save her!’ he cried, gripping his sword and dagger.
He wanted to do something nice for Wendy right now. He
could take his medicine. He promised her.
</p><p>
He took the cup.
</p><p>
‘No!’ cried Tinker Bell.
</p><p>
‘Why not?’</p><p>
‘There is poison in it.’
</p><p>
‘Poison? There can’t be any poison.’
</p><p>
‘Hook poisoned it.’
</p><p>
‘Don’t be silly. Hook can’t get here’
</p><p>
He seemed to be right. Tinker Bell did not know the dark
secret of Slightly’s tree. But she heard Hook’s muttering,
and she knew there was poison in the cup.
</p><p>
‘Besides,’ said Peter, quite believing himself, ‘I didn’t fall
asleep.’
</p><p>
He raised the cup. There was no time for words now; it
was time for actions. And Tink hurried between his lips and
the cup, and drank it.
</p><p>
‘Tink, why did you drink my medicine?’
</p><p>
But she did not answer. She was ﬂying with difficulty.
</p><p>
‘What is the matter with you?’ cried Peter, suddenly
afraid.
</p><p>
‘It was poison, Peter,’ she told him softly; ‘and now I am
going to die.’
</p><p>
‘O, Tink, did you drink it to save me?’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘But why, Tink?’
</p><p>
The wings didn’t carry her, and she landed on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear ‘You fool,’ and then she walked
to her room and lay down on the bed.
</p><p>
He dropped on his knees near her room, and the tears
were running down his cheeks. Her light was growing faint.
Her voice was so low that at first he could not understand
what she said. Then he understood.
</p><p>
‘I still can get well,’ she said. ‘Fairies always get well
when children believe in them.’
There were no children there, and it was night time; but
Peter addressed all children dreaming of the Neverland,
boys and girls who were quite near him in their dreams.
</p><p>
‘Do you believe?’ he cried.
</p><p>
Tink sat up in bed to listen.
</p><p>
‘What do you think?’ she asked Peter.
</p><p>
‘Do you believe in fairies?’ he shouted to them. ‘Then
clap your hands; don’t let Tink die.’
</p><p>
Many clapped. Some didn’t.
</p><p>
Suddenly the clapping stopped, as thousands ofmothers
rushed to their nurseries to know what was happening
there. But it was enough. Tink got well.
</p><p>
Her voice grew strong, she jumped out of bed, and next
moment she was flying merrily.
</p><p>
‘And now to save Wendy!’
</p><p>
Peter rose from his tree with his weapons. The moon
was high in the sky. It meant he couldn’t ﬂy low, because
his shadow would disturb the birds, and they would make
noise and warn the pirates of his approach.
</p><p>
Peter had to go through the forest looking for footmarks
and all sort of signs. ‘They all know how to leave me a sign,’
he said to himself. ‘Slightly can set fire to a tree, and Curly
can drop seeds, and Wendy can leave her handkerchief at
some important place.’
</p><p>
The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing,
not a sound, not a movement; but he knew well that danger
might be at the next tree.
</p><p>
‘Hook or me this time,’ he swore.
</p><p>
He crawled forward like a snake, and then jumped on his
feet and ran silently, one finger on his lips and his dagger
ready at hand. He was very happy.
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 14</span> The Pirate Ship</h3>
<div>


<p>
The pirate ship ‘Jolly Roger’ lay low in the water in the
</p><p>
mouth of the pirate river. The pirates were on the deck.
</p><p>
Some of them were playing cards, and four of them
</p><p>
were sleeping (they were tired after carrying the little house
</p><p>
with their prisoners). No one was keeping watch, because the
people were too much afraid of the ship to attack it.
</p><p>
Hook was walking on the deck deep in thought. It was
his hour of triumph. Peter Pan was dead, and the other boys
were on the ship about to walk the plank.
</p><p>
Hook felt very lonely. This man never felt more alone
than when his dogs — the pirates — were around him.
</p><p>
Hook was not his true name. I can’t tell you his real name
because it will be a shock for many. He still remembered
traditions of his public school, and he still had the passion
for good manners.
</p><p>
Good manners! This is all that really matters. He knew
it. And he kept thinking ofgood manners. But there was one
important question: ‘Is it not bad manners to think about
good manners?’
</p><p>
He didn’t know.
</p><p>
There came to him a presentiment of his early death.
Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech. He
wasn’t sure he would have time for it later.
</p><p>
‘No little children to love me!’ he thought.
</p><p>
It was the first time he thought about it. It was strange.
He looked at Smee. Smee was quite happy. He was sure the 
children were afraid of him. But they loved him. He said
horrible things to them, and hit them with the palm of his
hand, but they loved him. Why? What was his secret? Good
manners?
He was ready to claw Smee, but he thought, ‘What is it, to
claw a man because he has good manners? Bad manners!’
</p><p>
The pirates got noisy, and he immediately quieted them,
and there was no sign of human weakness on his face.
</p><p>
‘Did you chain the children, so that they cannot fly away?’
Hook asked the pirates.
</p><p>
‘Yes, sir.’
</p><p>
‘Then bring them here.’
</p><p>
The poor prisoners, all except Wendy, lined up in front
of him. For a time he seemed not to notice them. Then he
said: ‘So, six of you will now walk the plank, but I need two
cabin boys. Which of you will join us?’
</p><p>
The boys remembered Wendy’s words, ‘Don’t irritate
him unnecessarily.’
</p><p>
Tootles stepped forward. He didn’t want to join the pirates, but he decided to lay responsibility on someone else.
Mothers are always willing to be the buffer. All children
know it, and despise them for that, but often make use
of it.
</p><p>
So Tootles stepped forward, and said, ‘You see, sir, I don’t
think my mother would like me to be a pirate. Would your
mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?’
</p><p>
He looked at Slightly, who said: ‘I don’t think so.’
</p><p>
‘Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t think so,’ said the first twin, as clever as the
others.
</p><p>
‘Nibs, would — ’</p><p>
‘Stop it’, said Hook. ‘You, boy’, he said to John, ‘did you
ever want to be a pirate?’
</p><p>
]ohn really sometimes dreamed about it and he was surprised that Hook chose him.
</p><p>
‘I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Iack,’ he
said uncertainly.
</p><p>
‘Good name. We’ll call you that here, just you join us.’
</p><p>
‘What do you think, Michael?’ asked ]ohn.
</p><p>
‘What would you call me?’ Michael asked.
</p><p>
‘Blackbeard Ioe.’
</p><p>
‘What do you think, Iohn?’ Michael asked. He wanted
John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.
</p><p>
‘You must swear, “Down with the King,” added Hook.
</p><p>
‘Then I refuse,’ ]ohn cried.
</p><p>
‘And I refuse,’ cried Michael.
</p><p>
Hook shouted:
</p><p>
‘All right then. Bring up their mother. Get the plank
ready.’
</p><p>
They were only boys, and they went white as they saw
Iukes and Cecco preparing the plank. But they tried to look
brave when pirates brought Wendy up.
</p><p>
Wendy despised those pirates very much. To the boys
there was some glamour in being a pirate. But all that she
saw was that it was very dirty on the ship.
</p><p>
‘So, my beauty,’ said Hook, ‘you will see your children
walk the plank.’
</p><p>
‘Will they die?’ asked Wendy.
</p><p>
‘They will,’ he said. ‘Silence all, for a mother’s last words
to her children.’
</p><p>
‘These are my last words, dear boys,’ Wendy said firmly.
‘I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers, 
and it is this: ”We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen.”’</p><p>
The words impressed even the pirates, and Tootles cried
out hysterically, ‘I am going to do what my mother hopes.
What about you, Nibs?’
</p><p>
‘I’m going to do what my mother hopes. What about you,
Twin?’
</p><p>
‘I’m going to do what my mother hopes. What about you,
Iohn?’
</p><p>
But Hook found his voice again.
</p><p>
‘Tie her up!’ he shouted.
</p><p>
Smee tied her to the mast. ‘Listen, dear,’ he whispered,
‘I can save you, but you must promise to be my mother.’
</p><p>
But not even for Smee she would make such a promise.
‘I will rather have no children at all,’ she said.
</p><p>
The boys didn’t look at her. The eyes of all were on the
plank: the boys were about to take their last little walk.
They were trembling.
</p><p>
Hook smiled on them and took a step toward Wendy.
He wanted to turn her face so that she could see the boys
walking the plank one by one. But he didn’t reach her. He
stopped, because he heard something.
</p><p>
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.
</p><p>
They all heard it — pirates, boys — and they immedi-
ately turned their heads in one direction. Everybody was
looking at Hook. They knew that what was going to happen
was going to happen to him.
</p><p>
It was frightening, the change that came over him. He
looked weak and afraid.
</p><p>
The sound came steadily nearer, and they all thought:
‘The crocodile is about to board the ship!’ Hook was moving
 on all fours along the deck, trying to get as far from the
sound as he could
‘Hide me!’ he cried.
</p><p>
The pirates gathered around him. No one was watching
the crocodile coming aboard. They were not going to fight
it. It was Fate.
</p><p>
But the boys were curious. They rushed to the ship’s side
to see the crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights: it was not a crocodile
coming. It was Peter. He signed them to keep silence and
continued to tick.
</p>
</div>


	<h3><span>CHAPTER 15</span> ‘Hook Or Me This Time’</h3>
<div>


<p>
When last we saw Peter he was going across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger
ready at hand. He saw the crocodile pass by and
did not notice anything unusual. But later it struck him that
the crocodile wasn’t ticking any more.
</p><p>
Peter began to think how he could turn it to his own use.
He decided to start ticking. The wild beasts would take him
for the crocodile and let him pass. He ticked perfectly. The
crocodile heard him, too, and for an unknown purpose it
followed him.
</p><p>
Peter reached the shore without any trouble. As he
swam, he had just one thought: ‘Hook or me this time.’
He didn’t even notice that he went on ticking. So he couldn’t 
see why the pirates stepped back and Hook was so much
afraid.</p><p>
Then he remembered the crocodile, and as soon as
he did it, he heard the ticking. Next moment he realized
that he was doing it himself. ‘How clever of me!’ Peter
thought
</p><p>
It was at this moment that one of the pirates, Ed Teynte,
appeared on the deck. Peter struck true and deep. Ed fell
forward. Four boys caught him not to let the body make
any noise. Peter gave the signal, and they threw the pirate
overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. It all
happened in a minute.
</p><p>
‘One!’ (Slightly began to count.)
</p><p>
Peter tiptoed to the cabin. The other pirates realized
that there was no ticking any more.
</p><p>
‘It’s all right, captain,’ Smee said. ‘All’s quiet again.’
</p><p>
Hook listened carefully. There was no sound, and he
rose to his feet.
</p><p>
‘Then back to the plank!’ he cried, hating the boys more
than ever. They were witnesses to his fear.
</p><p>
‘Do you want a touch of the cat before you walk the
plank?’ he asked them.
</p><p>
At that they fell on their knees. ‘No, no!’ they cried.
</p><p>
‘Bring the cat, Iukes,’ said Hook; ‘it’s in the cabin.’
</p><p>
The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children looked
at each other.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ said Iukes, and he went into the cabin. The pirates
started another horrible song.
They had to stop it, because they heard a scream from
the cabin, and then a crowing sound. It really puzzled the
pirates.
</p><p>
‘What was that?’ cried Hook.
</p><p>
‘Two,’ said Slightly.
</p><p>
The Italian Cecco rushed into the cabin. He came out
unsteadily.
</p><p>
‘What’s the matter with Bill Iukes?’ asked Hook.
</p><p>
‘He is dead,’ answered Cecco.
</p><p>
‘Bill ]ukes dead!’ cried the pirates.
</p><p>
‘There is dark in the cabin, but there is something terrible in there; you heard it crowing.’
</p><p>
‘Cecco,’ Hook said, ‘go back and bring me out this cock.’
</p><p>
Cecco didn’t want to go, but Hook showed him his iron
claw. Cecco went into the cabin. There was no more singing,
all were listening now; and again there came a scream and
again a crow.
</p><p>
No one spoke except Slightly. ‘Three,’ he said.
</p><p>
‘Who will bring me that cock?’ Hook said.
</p><p>
‘Wait till Cecco comes out,’ muttered Starkey.
</p><p>
‘Do you want to go, Starkey?’ said Hook.
</p><p>
‘No!’ Starkey cried.
</p><p>
‘My hook thinks you do,’ said Hook, approaching him.
</p><p>
Starkey looked around for help, but everyone stepped
back. With a terrible scream the pirate threw himself overboard and into the sea.
</p><p>
‘Four,’ said Slightly.
</p><p>
‘I’ll bring out that cock myself,’ Hook said, and went into
the cabin.
</p><p>
‘Five,’ that was what Slightly wanted to say. But Hook
came out, quite unsteadily and without his lantern.
‘Something blew out the light,’ Hook said.
</p><p>
‘What of Cecco?’ asked Noodler.
</p><p>
‘He is as dead as Iukes,’ said Hook shortly.
</p><p>
‘Our ship is doomed!’ said the pirates.
</p><p>
The boys cheered, and Hook immediately turned to
them.
</p><p>
‘Open the cabin and let them go in. Let them fight with
this cock for their lives. We don’t care for the result,’ Hook
said.
</p><p>
The boys pretended to be unhappy about it. The pirates
pushed them in and closed the door.
</p><p>
‘Now, listen!’ cried Hook, and all listened. But no one
dared to watch the door, they all turned away. Wendy was
the only one who was watching the door. She was waiting
for Peter.
</p><p>
She didn’t wait for a long time. In the cabin Peter found
what he needed: a key to unchain the boys. They armed
themselves with all sorts of things they found in the cabin.
Then Peter signed them to hide and hurried to free Wendy.
</p><p>
Then they could easily ﬂy away. But there was Peter’s
oath, ‘Hook or me this time!’ Peter signed Wendy to hide,
too, and put on her cloak, and took her place by the mast.
Then he crowed.
</p><p>
‘It killed the boys, then,’ the pirates thought. They were
afraid more than ever. Hook tried to calm them down. But
he saw that they were ready to attack him.
</p><p>
‘I see it now, boys,’ he said. ‘There is a person on board
who is the cause of the problem’.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ they muttered, ‘a man with a hook.’
</p><p>
‘No, no, it’s the girl. A woman on board means no luck
for a pirate ship.’
‘Maybe,’ they said uncertainly.
</p><p>
‘Throw the girl overboard,’ cried Hook. And they rushed
to the mast.
</p><p>
‘There’s no one who can save you now’.
</p><p>
‘There’s one,’ answered the figure.
</p><p>
‘Who’s that?’
</p><p>
‘Peter Pan!’ As he spoke Peter threw off his cloak.
</p><p>
Now it was clear who the terrible creature was. Hook
tried to speak, but he couldn’t.
</p><p>
At last he cried, ‘Cut him into pieces!’, but his voice
sounded uncertainly.
</p><p>
‘Down, boys!’ Peter called out; and in another moment
the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. The pirates were too frightened to fight together, they were just
running and waving their swords. Each of them believed
that he was the only one still alive. Some of them jumped
overboard, others hid in dark corners, where Slightly found them. He didn’t fight, but he was running about
with a lantern and counted: ‘five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven.’
</p><p>
Finally there was only Hook fighting. The boys formed
a ring around him and kept attacking him, but they couldn’t
win.
</p><p>
‘Stop it, boys,’ cried a boy, hurrying to the circle, ‘this
man is mine.’
</p><p>
And Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The
others stepped back and formed a ring around them.
</p><p>
For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook
shuddering, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.
</p><p>
‘So, Pan,’ said Hook at last, ‘this is all your doing.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, Iames Hook,’ came the answer, ‘it is all my doing.’
‘Proud and insolent youth,’ said Hook, ‘prepare to meet
your death.’
</p><p>
‘Dark and evil man, I will destroy you’, said Peter.
</p><p>
Without more words they began the fight. Both were
perfect swordsmen. Hook was not so quick as Peter, but his
arm was longer. He had a hook, too, and finally he tried to
claw Peter. But Peter doubled, and pierced Hook in the ribs.
At the sight of his own blood, and the unusual colour of it,
the sword fell from Hook’s hand.
</p><p>
‘Now!’ cried all the boys. But Peter offered Hook to pick
up his sword. Hook did it quickly, but he felt that Peter was
showing good manners.
</p><p>
‘Pan, who and what are you?’ he cried.
</p><p>
‘I’m youth, I’m joy,’ Peter answered.
</p><p>
This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the
unhappy Hook that Peter did not know who or what he was.
It is a sign of having good manners.
</p><p>
Hook was fighting now without hope. There was only
one thing he wanted to see before his death: to see Peter
showing bad manners.
</p><p>
Seeing Peter’s approach, he got ready to jump overboard and into the sea. He didn’t know that the crocodile
was waiting for him in the water. He had one last triumph.
Looking at Peter through his shoulder, he invited him with
a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of
stab.
</p><p>
‘Bad manners!’ Hook said and went down to the crocodile. That’s how Iames Hook died.
</p><p>
‘Seventeen,’ Slightly said; but he was not quite correct.
Fifteen pirates died that night, but two reached the shore.
The Indians caught Starkey and made him nurse all their 
children. Smee wandered about the world telling people,
‘I’m the only man ]as. Hook feared!’
</p><p>
Wendy praised the boys equally, and then she took them
into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch. It said ‘half—past
two’! She immediately put them to bed — all except Peter,
who kept walking along the deck, and then he fell asleep
near Long Tom, and had one of his bad dreams, and cried in
his sleep for a long time, and Wendy hugged him to comfort
him.
</p>

	<h3><span>CHAPTER 16</span> The Return Home</h3>
<div>


<p>
There was a big sea voyage. They all dressed in pirate 
clothes cut off at the knee, and looked and behaved 
like real sailors. It is quite clear who was the captain.
</p><p>
The ship was heading for the mainland, and they were going
to ﬂy from the Azores.
</p><p>
Some of the boys wanted the ship to be an honest ship,
and others wanted it to be a pirate one. But the captain treated them as dogs, and they did not express their wishes to
him. Now it was an honest ship. But the boys thought it was
not for long. ‘Peter is honest because Wendy is anxious. But
she will finish his new suit quite soon. What will happen
then?’ they thought. Wendy had to make him a new suit out
of Hook’s clothes, you see, though she didn’t like the idea.
</p><p>
And now, while the children are on their way home, let’s
return to the empty nursery. We’re going there to make sure 
everything is ready to meet them and Mr. and Mrs. Darling
are not going out for the evening.
What I really want to do is to tell Mrs. Darling: ‘Your
children are coming back!’ On their ways home they imagine their return: mother’s delight, father’s shout of joy and
Nana’s leap through the air to hug them first, though what
they really deserve is a severe punishment. Let’s inform
their parents in advance and spoil the surprise.
</p><p>
But it’s no use. No one will say ‘thank you’ for it.
Mrs. Darling will say, ‘How could you spoil the children’s
fun?’
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling doesn’t need to make arrangements for the
children’s return. Everything is ready. She never leaves the
house, and the window is open.
</p><p>
The only change in the night-nursery is that between
nine and siX the kennel is no longer there. When the children ﬂew away, Mr. Darling felt that all the blame was his.
‘Nana was right, and I was wrong,’ he thought. He thought
the matter over, and got on all fours and crawled into the
kennel. Mrs. Darling kept asking him to come out, but he
always answered:
</p><p>
‘No, dear, this is the place for me. I won’t leave the kennel. Not till the children come back.’
</p><p>
He did not let Nana into the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes.
</p><p>
Each morning Mr. Darling in his kennel was going to the
office by cab, and he returned home in the same way at six.
Now he didn’t care about the neighbours’ opinion.
</p><p>
On that eventful Thursday, Mrs. Darling was in the
night-nursery waiting for George’s return home and there
was no one in the room but Nana.
‘O Nana, I dreamt that my dear children came back,’ said
Mrs. Darling.
</p><p>
All that Nana could do was to give her a paw; and they
were sitting together, waiting for Mr. Darling.
</p><p>
A crowd of people accompanied Mr. Darling on his way
home; mostly little boys, but there were several adults as
well.
</p><p>
‘Will you play to me on the nursery piano?’ he asked his
wife when he was going to sleep. ‘And will you close the
window? It’s cold.’
</p><p>
‘O George, never ask me to do that. The window must
always be open for them, always, always.’
</p><p>
And she went into the day-nursery and played, and soon
he fell asleep; and while he slept, someone ﬂew into the
room. No, they are not Wendy and John and Michael. They
are Peter and Tinker Bell.
</p><p>
‘Quick, Tink,’ Peter whispered, ‘close the window! That’s
right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when
Wendy comes she will see the closed window and she will
have to go back with me.’
</p><p>
Then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was
playing. He whispered to Tink:
</p><p>
‘It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so
pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not
so full as my mother’s was.’
</p><p>
Of course he knew nothing about his mother.
</p><p>
He didn’t know the music, but he knew it was saying
‘Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.’
</p><p>
And Peter cried in answer: ‘You will never see Wendy
again, lady! I closed the window!’
The music stopped, and he peeped in to see why. Mrs.
Darling laid her head on the box, and there were two tears
in her eyes.
</p><p>
‘She wants me to open the window,’ thought Peter, ‘but
I won’t!’
</p><p>
The tears were still there.
</p><p>
‘She’s awfully fond of Wendy,’ he said to himself. He was
angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have
Wendy.
</p><p>
The reason was so simple: ‘I’m fond ofher, too. We can’t
both have her, lady.’
</p><p>
But the lady could not see it, and he was unhappy. He
made funny faces and tried to feel careless. But he couldn’t.
</p><p>
‘All right,’ he said, and opened the window. ‘Come on,
Tink,’ he cried and ﬂew away.
</p><p>
So Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for
them after all, which of course was more than they deserved.
They dropped on the ﬂoor shamelessly, and Michael said:
</p><p>
‘Iohn, this place looks familiar.’
</p><p>
‘Of course it does. There is your old bed.’
</p><p>
‘So it is,’ Michael said uncertainly.
</p><p>
‘The kennel!’ cried John, and he went across to look into it.
</p><p>
‘Maybe Nana is inside it,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
But John shook his head. ‘There’s a man inside it,’ he
said.
</p><p>
‘It’s father!’ exclaimed Wendy.
</p><p>
‘Let me see father,’ Michael said, and took a good look.</p><p>
‘He is not so big as the pirate I killed.’
</p><p>
Father sleeping in the kennel surprised Wendy and John
very much.
</p><p>
‘Did he really sleep in the kennel?’ John asked.</p><p>
‘John,’ Wendy said, ‘it seems we don’t remember the old
life as well as we thought we did.’
</p><p>
‘It is very careless of mother,’ said John insolently, ‘not to
be here when we come back.’
</p><p>
Next moment Mrs. Darling began playing again.
</p><p>
‘It’s mother!’ cried Wendy.
</p><p>
‘So it is!’ said John.
</p><p>
‘Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?’ asked Michael, who was very sleepy.
</p><p>
‘Oh!’ exclaimed Wendy, ‘we came back in time!’
</p><p>
‘Let’s enter the room quietly and put our hands over her
eyes,’ said John.
</p><p>
But Wendy offered a better plan.
</p><p>
‘Let’s go to bed, and be there when she comes in.’
</p><p>
And so they did. Mrs. Darling came in to make sure her
husband was sleeping. The children waited for her cry of
joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so
often in her dreams that she thought this was just another
dream.
</p><p>
She sat down in the chair by the fire. Children could not
understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of
them.
</p><p>
‘Mother!’ Wendy cried.
</p><p>
‘That’s Wendy,’ she said, but still she was sure it was the
dream.
</p><p>
‘Mother!’
</p><p>
‘That’s Iohn,’ she said.
</p><p>
‘Mother!’ cried Michael. He remembered her now.
</p><p>
‘That’s Michael,’ she said, and she stretched out her arms
for the three little selfish children, and they ran to her.
‘George, George!’ she cried when she could speak; and
Mr. Darling woke to share her joy, and Nana rushed in.
</p><p>
That was a lovely sight! But there was no one to see
it, except the little boy, who was staring in at the window.
His life was full of pleasures that other children can never
know. But he was looking through the window at the one
joy he could not have.
</p>
</div>

<h3><span>CHAPTER 17</span> When Wendy Grew Up</h3>
<div>


<p>
I hope you want to know what became ofthe other boys.
They were waiting below, counting for five hundred, to
give Wendy time to explain about them; then they went
up by stairs, to make a better impression. They stood in a
line in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off. ‘The pirate
clothes are quite out of place,’ they thought. They said
nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They
completely forgot about Mr. Darling.</p><p>
Of course Mrs. Darling said at once, ‘I will adopt you, all
of you!’ Mr. Darling was very unhappy. ‘SiX children are a
large number!’ he thought.</p><p>
‘I must say,’ he said to Wendy, ‘that you don’t do things
by halves.’</p><p>
The twins thought that he meant them.</p><p>
‘Do you think there are too many of us? We can go away,
sir’, said the first twin proudly.</p><p>
‘Father!’ Wendy cried, shocked.</p><p>
‘George!’ Mrs. Darling exclaimed.
</p><p>
Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out.
</p><p>
‘I’m very glad to adopt you, all of you,’ he said. ‘But why
didn’t you ask me? Am I a man of no importance in my own
house?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t think he is a man ofno importance!’ Tootles cried
immediately. ‘Do you, Curly?’
</p><p>
‘No, I don’t. Do you, Slightly?’
</p><p>
‘No, I don’t. What about you, twins?’
</p><p>
It turned out that none of them thought so. Mr. Darling
was happy again.
</p><p>
‘I will find space for you all in the drawing-room. I am
not sure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we
have, and it’s all the same’.
</p><p>
He went off dancing through the house, and they all
danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and they
found it somewhere, and they all fitted in.
</p><p>
As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he ﬂew
away. He did not exactly come to the window, but he passed
it so that she could open it if she liked and call to him. That
is what she did.
</p><p>
‘Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,’ he said.
</p><p>
‘Oh Peter, are you going away?’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘Don’t you feel, Peter,’ she said, ‘that you would like to
say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?’
</p><p>
‘No.’
</p><p>
‘About me, Peter?’
</p><p>
‘No.’
</p><p>
Mrs. Darling came to the window, because she was keep-
ing a sharp eye on Wendy. She said to Peter:
‘I adopted all the other boys, and want to adopt you, too.’
</p><p>
‘Will you send me to school?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘And then to an office?’
</p><p>
‘I think so.’
</p><p>
‘Soon I will be a man?’
</p><p>
‘Very soon.’
</p><p>
‘I don’t want to go to school and learn serious things,’
he said. ‘I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, just
imagine: one morning I wake up and I have a beard!’
</p><p>
‘Peter,’ said Wendy, ‘I will love you with a beard,’ and Mrs.
Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he ﬂew back.
</p><p>
‘Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make
me a man.’
</p><p>
‘But where are you going to live?’
</p><p>
‘With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies
will put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at
nights.’
</p><p>
‘How lovely,’ cried Wendy. Her delight made Mrs. Darling
take her arm.
</p><p>
‘I thought there were no more fairies,’ Mrs. Darling said.
</p><p>
‘There are always a lot of young ones,’ explained Wen-
dy, ‘because, you see, when a new baby laughs for the first
time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies
there are always new fairies.’
</p><p>
‘I will have such fun,’ said Peter, looking at Wendy.
</p><p>
‘It will be rather lonely in the evening,’ she said, ‘sitting
by the fire.’
</p><p>
‘Well, then, come with me to the little house.’
</p><p>
‘May I, mummy?’
</p><p>
‘Certainly not. You’re home again, and I want to keep you.’</p><p>
‘But he does so need a mother!’
</p><p>
‘So do you, my love.’
</p><p>
‘All right,’ Peter said, pretending that he invited her only
to be polite. But Mrs. Darling saw that his lip was trembling.
</p><p>
‘I can let Wendy go to you for a week, to help you with
your spring cleaning,’ she said. ‘Would you like that?’
</p><p>
‘Spring will be so long in coming,’ Wendy sighed. But Peter was quite happy once again. He had no sense of time.
</p><p>
‘You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring clean-
ing time comes?’
</p><p>
‘Of course I won’t,’ Peter said. And then he ﬂew away. He
took Mrs. Darling’s kiss before leaving. The kiss in the corner
of her mouth no one could have. Peter took it quite easily.
</p><p>
Of course all the boys went to school, and a week later
each of them thought, ‘What fools we are! Why did we leave
the island?’ But it was too late now, and soon they became
quite ordinary people like you and me. Soon they forgot
how to ﬂy. ‘Not enough practice,’ they said. But what it really
meant that they no longer believed.
</p><p>
Michael believed longer than the other boys; so he was
with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end ofthe first
year. She flew away with Peter in the dress she made from
the leaves and berries living in the Neverland, and her one
fear was the thought, ‘Of course he will notice how short it
is now!’ But he didn’t. He had so much to say about himself.
</p><p>
It turned out they couldn’t discuss the events ofthe past.
He didn’t remember them.
</p><p>
‘Who is Captain Hook?’ he asked with interest when she
spoke of his enemy.
</p><p>
‘Don’t you remember,’ she asked in surprise, ‘how you
killed him and saved all our lives?’
‘I forget them after I kill them,’ he answered carelessly.
</p><p>
‘Who is Tinker Bell?’ he asked next. Wendy explained,
but it was no use. He didn’t remember.
</p><p>
Next year he did not come for her.
</p><p>
‘Perhaps he is ill,’ Michael said.
</p><p>
‘You know he is never ill.’
</p><p>
Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver,
‘Perhaps there is no such person, Wendy!’ He was crying.
</p><p>
Peter came next spring. He didn’t remember anything
about his missing the last year.
</p><p>
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. When
they met again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter
was no more to her than a memory. Wendy was a grown up
woman. She was one of those who liked to grow up.
</p><p>
All the boys grew up, too. You may see the twins and
Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying
a little bag and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver.
Slightly married a lady of title, and he became a lord.
Do you see that judge? That was once Tootles. The man
who doesn’t know any story to tell his children was once
Iohn.
</p><p>
Wendy was married, and Peter Pan didn’t come to the
church to stop the ceremony. Then Wendy had a daughter.
Her name was Iane. She loved to hear of Peter Pan, and
Wendy told her all she could remember.
</p><p>
Iane slept in Wendy’s old nursery. It was lane’s nursery
now. There were only two beds in it, lane’s and her nurse’s;
and there was no kennel.
</p><p>
Once a week lane’s nurse had her evening off; and
then it was Wendy’s task to put lane to bed. That was the
time for stories. Iane usually raises the sheet over her 
mother’s head and her own and in the awful darkness she
whispers: ‘What do we see now?’
</p><p>
‘I don’t think I see anything tonight,’ says Wendy.
</p><p>
‘Yes, you do,’ says Iane, ‘you see the time when you were
a little girl.’
</p><p>
‘That is a long time ago, dear,’ says Wendy. ‘Oh, how time
ﬂies!’
</p><p>
‘Does it ﬂy,’ asks the child, ‘the way you ﬂew when you
were a little girl?’
</p><p>
‘The way I ﬂew? Do you know, lane, sometimes I’m not
sure I really could ﬂy.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, you could.’
</p><p>
‘The dear old days when I could ﬂy!’
</p><p>
‘Why can’t you ﬂy now, mother?’
</p><p>
‘Because I grew up. When people grow up they forget
the way.’
</p><p>
‘Why do they forget the way?’
</p><p>
‘Because they are no longer merry and innocent and
heartless. It is only the merry and innocent and heartless
who can ﬂy.’
</p><p>
‘What is merry and innocent and heartless? I want to be
merry and innocent and heartless.’
</p><p>
Sometimes Wendy says, ‘I see something. I do believe
that it is this nursery.’
</p><p>
‘I do believe it is,’ says Iane. ‘Go on.’
</p><p>
And once again they go through the great adventure of
the night when Peter ﬂew in looking for his shadow.
</p><p>
‘The foolish boy,’ says Wendy, ‘tried to stick it on with
soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me,
and I sewed it on for him.’
‘You missed a bit,’ interrupts Iane, who now knows the
story better than her mother. ‘When you saw him sitting on
the floor crying, what did you say?’
</p><p>
‘I sat up in bed and I said, “Boy, why are you crying?”’
</p><p>
‘Yes, that was it,’ says lane, with a big breath.
</p><p>
‘And then we all ﬂew away to the Neverland and the fairies
and the pirates and the Indians and the Mermaid’s lagoon,
and the home under the ground, and the little house.’
</p><p>
‘Yes! Which did you like best of all?’
</p><p>
‘I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to
you?’
</p><p>
‘The last thing he ever said to me was, “Iust always be
waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.”’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘But he forgot all about me,’ Wendy said it with a smile.
She was as grown up as that.
</p><p>
‘What did his crow sound like?’ Iane asked one evening.
</p><p>
‘It was like this,’ Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s
crow.
</p><p>
‘No, it wasn’t,’ Jane said, ‘it was like this,’ and she did it
ever so much better than her mother.
</p><p>
‘My darling, how can you know?’
</p><p>
‘I often hear it when I am sleeping,’ Jane said.
</p><p>
‘Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I
was the only one who heard it awake.’
</p><p>
‘Lucky you,’ said Iane.
</p><p>
And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring
ofthe year, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendy was
sitting on the ﬂoor, very close to the fire, because there was 
no other light in the nursery; and while she sat sewing she
heard a crow. Then the window opened, and Peter dropped
in on the ﬂoor.</p><p>
He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once
that he still had all his first teeth.
</p><p>
He was a little boy, and she was a grown up woman.
</p><p>
‘Hullo, Wendy,’ he said, not noticing any difference, because he was thinking only of himself.
</p><p>
‘Hullo, Peter,’ she answered. Something inside her was
crying ‘Woman, Woman, let go of me.’
</p><p>
‘Hullo, where is ]ohn?’ he asked, suddenly missing the
third bed.
</p><p>
‘]ohn is not here now,’ she answered.
</p><p>
‘Is Michael asleep?’ he asked, looking at lane.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter.
</p><p>
‘That is not Michael,’ she said quickly.
</p><p>
Peter looked. ‘Hullo, is it a new one?’
</p><p>
‘Yes.’
</p><p>
‘Boy or girl?’
</p><p>
‘Girl.’
</p><p>
But he didn’t understand.
</p><p>
‘Peter,’ she said, ‘are you expecting me to fly away with
you?’
</p><p>
‘Of course; that is why I’m here. Do you remember that
this is spring cleaning time?’
</p><p>
‘I can’t come,’ she said, ‘I don’t remember how to fly.’
</p><p>
‘I’ll soon teach you again.’
</p><p>
‘O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.’
</p><p>
She rose to her feet.
</p><p>
‘What is it?’ he cried.
‘I will turn up the light,’ she said, ‘and then you can see
for yourself.’
</p><p>
For almost the only time in his life Peter was afraid.
‘Don’t turn up the light,’ he cried.
</p><p>
She touched the hair of the tragic boy. She was not
a little girl with a broken heart; she was a grown woman
smiling at it all, but her eyes were wet.
</p><p>
Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave
a cry of pain.
</p><p>
‘What is it?’ he cried again.
</p><p>
‘I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty.
I grew up long ago,’ said Wendy.
</p><p>
‘You promised not to!’
</p><p>
‘I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.’
</p><p>
‘No, you’re not.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.’
</p><p>
‘No, she’s not.’
</p><p>
But he thought she was; and he took a step towards the
sleeping child. He sat down on the floor and began to cry;
Wendy did not know how to comfort him. She was only a
woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.
</p><p>
Peter continued to cry, and soon the sound woke lane.
She sat up in bed, and was curious at once.
</p><p>
‘Boy,’ she said, ‘why are you crying?’
</p><p>
Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from
the bed.
</p><p>
‘Hullo,’ he said.
</p><p>
‘Hullo,’ said lane.
</p><p>
‘My name is Peter Pan,’ he told her.
</p><p>
‘Yes, I know.’</p><p>
‘I came back for my mother,’ he explained, ‘to take her
to the Neverland.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, I know,’ Jane said. ‘Here am I.’
</p><p>
When Wendy returned she found Peter sitting on the
bed and crowing, while lane was happily flying round the
room.
</p><p>
‘She is my mother,’ Peter explained.
</p><p>
‘He does so need a mother,’ Jane said.
</p><p>
‘Yes, I know,’ Wendy said; ‘no one knows it so well as I.’
</p><p>
‘Good-bye,’ said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air,
and the shameless Iane rose with him.
</p><p>
Wendy rushed to the window.
</p><p>
‘No, no,’ she cried.
</p><p>
‘It is just for spring cleaning time,’ Jane said, ‘he wants
me always to do his spring cleaning.’
</p><p>
‘If only I could go with you,’ Wendy said.
</p><p>
‘You see you can’t ﬂy,’ said Iane.
</p><p>
Of course Wendy let them ﬂy away together. She stood
at the window, watching them ﬂying into the sky until they
were as small as stars.
</p><p>
As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becom-
ing white, and her figure little again, for all this happened
long ago. lane is now a common grown up, with a daugh-
ter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except
when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to
the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to
which he listens gladly. When Margaret grows up she will
have a daughter, who will be Peter’s mother in turn; and it
will go on that way, as long as children are merry, innocent
and heartless.

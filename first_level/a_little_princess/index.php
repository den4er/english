<h2>"A LITTLE PRINCESS" <span>Frances Burnett</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
<div>

<p>
Once on a dark winter’s day a little girl sat in
a carriage with her father. Sara Crewe was only
seven. But she felt as if she had a long, long life.
At this moment she was remembering the voyage
from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.</p><p>
“Papa,” she said, “papa.”</p><p>
“What is it, darling?” Captain Crewe answered,
holding her closer and looking down into her face.
“Is this the place?” Sara whispered. “Is it,
papa?”</p><p>
“Yes, little Sara, it is. We have come at last.”
And though she was only seven years old, she knew
that he felt sad when he said it.</p><p>
She always prepared herself for “the place,” as
she always called it. Her mother died. Her young,
handsome, rich father was her only relative. They
always played together and were fond of each other.
During her short life only one thing was a problem
for her and that thing was “the place” she was to
be taken to some day. The climate of India was 
very bad for children, and as soon as possible they
went to school in England.</p><p>
Her father felt he would be lonely on his return
to India. So he held her very closely in his arms
as the carriage rolled into the big square. It was a
big, dull, brick house; on the front door there were
black letters: MISS MINCHIN, Select Seminary for
Young Ladies.</p><p>
“Here we are, Sara,” said Captain Crewe.
“I don’t like it, papa,” she said.</p><p>
They came in. It was just then that Miss
Minchin entered the room. She was very like her
house: tall and respectable and ugly.</p><p>
“It will be great to have such a beautiful child,
Captain Crewe,” she said.</p><p>
Sara stood quietly. “Why does she say I am
a beautiful child?” she was thinking. “I am not
beautiful at all.” She was slim, rather tall for her
age, and had an attractive little face. Her hair was
heavy and black; her eyes were green and gray,
they were big, wonderful eyes.</p><p>
Sara stood near her father and listened while
he and Miss Minchin talked. “Sara likes learning,”
Captain Crewe said. “She is always sitting with her
little nose burrowing into books. Make her ride her
pony or go out and buy a new doll. She should
play more with dolls.”</p><p>
“Papa,” said Sara, “you see, dolls should be
friends. Emily is going to be my friend.”
Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and
Miss Minchin looked at Captain Crewe.</p><p>
“Who is Emily?” she asked.</p><p>
“Tell her, Sara,” Captain Crewe said, smiling.
Sara answered.</p><p>
“She is a doll I haven’t got yet,” she said.</p><p>
“She is a doll papa is going to buy for me. We
are going out together to find her. I have called her
Emily. She is going to be my friend when papa is
not here. I want to talk to her about him.”</p><p>
Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for
several days. They went out and visited many big
shops together, and bought many things. And at
last they found Emily, but they went to a number
of toy shops and looked at many dolls before they
discovered her. She was a large doll; she had goldenbrown
hair and her eyes were blue. “Of course,”
said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on
her knee, “of course, papa, this is Emily.”</p><p>
“Heigh-ho, little Sara!” Captain Crewe said to
himself “I don’t think you know how much your
daddy will miss you.”</p><p>
The next day he took her to Miss Minchin’s
and left her there. “She is a sensible little thing,
and she never wants anything it isn’t safe to give
her,” he said.</p><p>
He was to sail away the next morning. He went
with Sara into her little sitting room and they bade
each other goodbye.</p><p>
“Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?”
he said, stroking her hair.</p><p>
“No,” she answered. “I know you by heart.
You are in my heart.”</p><p>
And they put their arms round each other and
kissed as if they would never let each other go.
When the carriage went away, Sara was sitting
on the floor of her sitting room, while Captain Crewe
looked backward, waving and kissing his hand as
if he could not stop.</p>
</div>



<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>
<div>

<p>
When Sara entered the schoolroom the next
morning everybody looked at her with interested eyes.
All the girls knew that she was a special pupil and
had a lot of expensive things. Sara sat quietly in
her seat. She was interested and looked back quietly
at the children who looked at her.</p><p>
“Young ladies,” Miss Minchin said, “I want to
introduce you to your new companion.” </p><p>
“Sara,” said Miss Minchin “come here to me.”
She took a book from the desk.</p><p>
“As your papa has a French maid for you,”
she began, “I think that he wants you to learn
French well.”</p><p>
Sara said, “I think he took her,” she said,
“because he--he thought I would like her, Miss
Minchin.”</p><p>
“I am afraid,” said Miss Minchin, with a smile,
“that you shouldn’t always imagine that things are
for you because you like them.”</p><p>
The truth was that Sara could not remember
the time when she didn’t know French. Her mother
was a French woman, and Captain Crewe loved
her language.</p><p>
“I--I have never really learned French, but--
but--” she began.</p><p>
One of Miss Minchin’s secrets was that she
did not speak French herself and wanted to hide
this fact.</p><p>
“That is enough,” she said. “If you have not
learned, you must begin at once. The French teacher,
Monsieur Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes.
Take this book and look at it until he arrives.”
Sara’s cheeks felt warm. She went back to her
seat and opened the book.</p><p>
“You look rather angry, Sara,” Miss Minchin
said. “I am sorry you do not like the idea of
learning French.”</p><p>
“I am very fond of it,” answered Sara, thinking
she would try again; “but--”</p><p>
“You must not say ‘but’ when you must work,”
said Miss Minchin. “Look at your book again.”
“When Monsieur Dufarge comes,” Sara thought,
“I can make him understand.”</p><p>
Monsieur Dufarge arrived very soon. He was a
very nice, intelligent, middle-aged Frenchman.
“Is this a new pupil for me, madame?” he said
to Miss Minchin.</p><p>
“Her papa--Captain Crewe--thinks she should
begin the language. But I am afraid she does not
wish to learn,” said Miss Minchin.</p><p>
“I am sorry of that, mademoiselle,” he said
kindly to Sara. “Perhaps, when we begin to study
together, I may show you that it is charming.”
Little Sara rose in her seat. She began to
speak in good French. When she began to speak
Miss Minchin was shocked. Monsieur Dufarge began
to smile.</p><p>
“Ah, madame,” he said to Miss Minchin, “there
is not much I can teach her. She has not LEARNED
French; she is French. Her accent is beautiful.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” exclaimed Miss
Minchin.</p><p>
“I--I tried,” said Sara. “I--I suppose I did
not begin right.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin knew that and she saw that other
children began laughing.</p><p>
“Silence, young ladies!” she said. “Silence at
once!”</p><p>
And she began from that minute to feel rather
a grudge against her show pupil.</p>
</div>


<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>
<div>

<p>
On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss
Minchin’s side, she saw a fat girl. The girl’s eyes
looked at Sara every minute she turned to her.
When Sara began speaking French, the girl was so
surprised that she started chewing her hair. Miss
Minchin saw it and said: “Miss St. John! Take your
hair out of your mouth! Sit up at once!”</p><p>
Miss St. John gave a jump, Lavinia and Jessie
laughed. She became redder than ever and she
was going to cry. Sara saw her and was so sorry
for her that she began to like her and want to
be her friend. Sara noticed that St. John was bad
at learning. She couldn’t understand many things.
Many other girls laughed at her because of that.
But Sara didn’t.</p><p>
When the lessons were over, Sara looked for
Miss St. John, walked over to her and spoke.
“What is your name?” she said.</p><p>
St. John was surprised. The new pupil was
very special.</p><p>
“My name’s Ermengarde St. John,” she answered.
“Mine is Sara Crewe,” said Sara. “Yours is
wonderful!”</p><p>
“Do you like it?” said Ermengarde. “I like
yours.”</p><p>
Miss St. John’s problem in life was that she
had a clever father. He wanted her to learn and
didn’t want to understand that she couldn’t do it
well. She learned things and forgot them; or, if she
remembered them, she did not understand them.</p><p>
“You can speak French, can’t you?” she said.</p><p>
“I can speak it because I have heard it all my
life,” Sara answered.</p><p>
“I NEVER could speak it!” said Ermengarde.
“You are CLEVER, aren’t you?”</p><p>
Sara looked out of the window and she wondered
if she was.</p><p>
“I don’t know,” she said. “I can’t tell.” She
laughed and changed the subject because Ermengarde
looked sad.</p><p>
“Would you like to see Emily?” she asked.
“Who is Emily?” Ermengarde asked.</p><p>
“Come up to my room and see,” said Sara.
They went upstairs.</p><p>
“Let us go very quietly to the door,” Sara
whispered, “and then I will open it quite suddenly;
perhaps we may catch her.”</p><p>
The room was quite neat and quiet and a
wonderful doll sat in a chair, reading a book.
“Oh, she got back to her seat before we could
see her!” Sara explained.</p><p>
Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and
back again.</p><p>
“Can she--walk?” she asked.</p><p>
“Yes,” answered Sara. “At least I believe she
can. I pretend she can. Can you pretend things?”
“No,” said Ermengarde. “Tell me about it.”</p><p>
“Let us sit down,” said Sara, “Emily, you must
listen. This is Ermengarde St. John, Emily. Ermengarde,
this is Emily. Would you like to hold her?”
“Oh, may I?” said Ermengarde. “May I, really?
She is beautiful!” And Emily was in her arms.</p><p>
Miss St. John never dreamed of such a time
with a new pupil. They talked about dolls and India.
But after the story about Emily, Ermengarde
saw Sara’s face suddenly changed.</p><p>
“Have you got a pain?” Ermengarde asked.
“Yes,” Sara answered. “But it is not in my
body. Do you love your father more than anything
else in the whole world?”</p><p>
Ermengarde’s mouth fell open a little.</p><p>
“I see him seldom,” she said. “He is always
in the library reading things.”</p><p>
“I love mine more than all the world,” Sara
said. “That is my pain. He has gone away.”
“She’s going to cry,” thought Ermengarde.</p><p>
But she did not. “I promised him I would bear
it,” she said. “And I will.”</p><p>
“Lavinia and Jessie are best friends,” Ermengarde
said. “I wish we could be ‘best friends’. Would
you have me for yours? You’re clever, and I’m
the stupidest child in the school, but I like you!”
“I’m glad of that,” said Sara. “It makes you
thankful when you are liked. We will be friends.
And I’ll tell you what: I can help you with your
French lessons!”</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>
<div>

<p>
Life in Miss Minchin’s school could be very
bad for Sara. Everyone told her only nice things.
When guests came to school, Miss Minchin asked
Sara to speak French to them or tell them stories
about India. But Sara understood that she was not
an ideal person and often discussed her life with
Ermengarde. Most girls liked Sara. But Lavinia
hated Sara. She was very jealous of her.</p><p>
The little children loved Sara. She let them play
with Emily and was like a mother to them. Little
Lottie looked at her as if she was a queen. Lottie
was the youngest girl as her mother died and
her father sent her to school. She somehow learnt
about her mother’s death and when she wanted to
get something she used it. She cried and shouted
as loudly as she could.</p><p>
One day when Sara entered the room, Lottie
was lying upon the floor, shouting and kicking
her small fat legs. Poor plump Miss Amelia was 
trying first one method, and then another to calm
Lottie down.</p><p>
“Poor darling,” she said one moment, “I know
you haven’t got any mamma, poor--” Then in quite
another tone, “If you don’t stop, Lottie, I will shake
you. Poor little angel! There--! You bad child, I
will slap you! I will!”</p><p>
Sara went to them quietly. “Miss Amelia,” she
said in a low voice, “Miss Minchin says I may try
to make her stop, may I?”</p><p>
Sara asked Miss Amelia to go out of the room
and she was happy to do it.</p><p>
“I--haven’t--any--ma--ma--ma-a!” Lottie announced;
but her voice was not so strong.</p><p>
Sara looked at her with understanding in her
eyes. “Neither have I,” she said.</p><p>
Lottie was so surprised that she stopped crying
and asked, “Where is she?”</p><p>
“She went to heaven,” Sara said. “But I am
sure she comes out sometimes to see me, though I
don’t see her. So does yours. Perhaps they can both
see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room.”</p><p>
And Sara told Lottie a beautiful story about their
mothers and a place full of flowers where they lived.
Lottie listened very quietly to every word.</p><p>
“I want to go there,” she cried. “I--haven’t
got any mamma in this school.”</p><p>
“I will be your mamma,” Sara said and hugged
Lottie. “We will play that you are my little girl.
And Emily will be your sister.”</p><p>
“Shall she?” said Lottie. “Yes,” answered Sara,
“let us go and tell her. And then I will wash your
face and brush your hair.”</p><p>
And from that time Sara was an adopted
mother.
</p>
</div>


<h3>CHAPTER 5</h3>
<div>

<p>
Sara was very good at making up stories. In
the evening all the girls even Lavinia sat together
and listened to a new fairy tale. Sara made up a
story about mermaids. She noticed that a servant
girl also listened to the story. The girl looked very
dirty and tired. Sara asked her maid about that
girl. Her name was Becky and she did all the hard
work for school. Sara felt very sorry for her. Becky
looked very hungry.</p><p>
That day Sara came to her room after a dancing
lesson and saw Becky in her chair. Becky slept
and didn’t hear Sara. When she woke up she was
very frightened.</p><p>
“Oh, miss! Oh, miss!” she gasped. “I’m sorry,
miss!”</p><p>
Sara came quite close to her. “That’s fine. Don’t
be afraid. I won’t tell Miss Minchin.” “Have you
done your work?” she asked. “Can you stay here
a few minutes?”</p><p>
Becky lost her breath. “Here, miss? Me?”</p><p>
Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked
out and listened. “I thought-- perhaps—you might
like a piece of cake.”</p><p>
Sara opened a cupboard, and gave Becky a
thick slice of cake.</p><p>
“Becky,” she said, “did you listen to that story?”
“Yes, miss,” said Becky. “I knew I shouldn’t do
it but it was beautiful. May I listen to it again?”
“You may,” said Sara. “I’ll tell it ALL to you.”</p><p>
When Becky went downstairs, she was not the
same Becky. She had an extra piece of cake in her
pocket, and she felt warm. But it wasn’t the room
and the cake. Something else warmed and fed her,
and the something else was Sara.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 6</h3>
<div>

<p></p><p>
Not very long after this a very exciting thing
happened. Not only Sara, but all the school, found
it exciting. In one of his letters Captain Crewe
told a most interesting story. An old friend came
to see him in India. He was the owner of land
where there were diamonds and he was going to
build the mines. That could make Sara the richest
person in the world. Ermengarde and Lottie loved
listening about the mines. But Lavinia and Jessie
thought the mines were just a fairy tale.</p><p>
That morning Lottie cried and shouted a lot.
Lavinia was angry and wanted to slap Lottie. Sara
jumped up from her place and came up to Lavinia.</p><p>
“Well,” she said, “I would like to slap YOU-
- but I don’t want to slap you! We are both old
enough to know better.”</p><p>
Here was Lavinia’s opportunity.</p><p>
“Ah, yes, your royal highness,” she said. “We
are princesses, I believe. At least one of us is.”
Sara started toward her. It was her secret. She
liked to think that she was a princess. She felt shy.
When she spoke it was in a quiet voice; she
held her head up, and everybody listened to her.
“It’s true,” she said. “Sometimes I do pretend I
am a princess. I pretend I am a princess, so that
I can try and behave like one.”</p><p>
Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing
to say. She could only invent one remark, and it
fell rather flat.</p><p>
“Dear me,” she said, “I hope, when you ascend
the throne, you won’t forget us!”</p><p>
“I won’t,” said Sara and went away.</p><p>
After this, the girls spoke of her as “Princess
Sara”.</p><p>
A few weeks before Sara’s eleventh birthday
a letter came to her from her father, it was sad.
Captain Crewe was not very well, and worried about
the diamond mines.</p><p>
“You see, little Sara,” he wrote, “your daddy
is not a businessman at all. He doesn’t understand
the documents. If my little missus were here, she
would give me some good advice”.</p><p>
One of his many jokes had been to call her
his “little missus” because she was old-fashioned.
He made wonderful preparations for her birthday.
Among other things, there was a new doll from
Paris and her dresses.</p><p>
“I am getting very old,” Sara wrote; “you see,
I will never live to have another doll. This will be
my last doll.”</p><p>
Captain Crewe laughed like a child when he
saw this.</p><p>
“Oh,” he said, “she’s better fun every year she
lives. What wouldn’t I give to have her little arms
round my neck this minute! What WOULDN’T I
give?”</p><p>
Sara’s birthday came and there was going to be
a great party at school. Early in the morning Becky
came to Sara. She brought her a pincushion with
a card. She made it herself from old cloth. Sara
hugged Becky and she thought it was one of the
best presents for her.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 7</h3>
<div>

<p>
When Sara entered the schoolroom, Miss
Minchin came. Becky was with her. She had a box
with “The Last Doll” in her hands. Miss Minchin
gave Sara the presents and gave the start to her
party. Sara asked Becky to stay. Miss Minchin
didn’t like it but let Sara do it. Miss Minchin made
a speech. She called Sara her best pupil and the
real princess in the school.</p><p>
Then she left the children to party and went
to her room. A thin man waited for her there. He
saw “The Last Doll”.</p><p>
“Birthday presents,” said Mr. Barrow in the
critical manner, “to a child eleven years old! All of
them are so expensive!”</p><p>
“Captain Crewe is a rich man,” Miss Minchin
said. “The diamond mines alone--”</p><p>
Mr. Barrow cried. “Diamond mines! There are
none! Never were!”</p><p>
Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.
“What!” she cried. “What do you mean?”</p><p>
“When a man is in the hands of a very dear
friend and is not a businessman, he shouldn’t have
any business with diamond mines, or gold mines.
The late Captain Crewe--”</p><p>
Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.</p><p>
“The LATE Captain Crewe!” she cried out.</p><p>
“The LATE! You don’t come to tell me that Captain
Crewe is--”</p><p>
“He’s dead, madam,” Mr. Barrow answered.</p><p>
“Died of jungle fever and business problems. Captain
Crewe is dead!”</p><p>
Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again. The
words he had spoken filled her with alarm.
“What WERE his business problems?” she said.</p><p>
“What WERE they?”</p><p>
“Diamond mines,” answered Mr. Barrow, “and
ruin.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin couldn’t speak for a minute..
“Ruin!” she gasped out.</p><p>
“Lost every penny. That young man had too
much money. He died asking about his dear girl
and didn’t leave a penny.”</p><p>
Now Miss Minchin understood.</p><p>
“Do you mean to tell me,” she cried out, “that
he left NOTHING! That Sara will have no fortune!
That the child is a beggar! That she is on
my hands?!”</p><p></p><p>
“She is certainly left a beggar,” Mr. Barrow
answered. “And she is certainly left on your hands,
madam--as she has no family at all.”</p><p></p><p>
“But what am I to do?” cried Miss Minchin,
“What am I to do?”</p><p></p><p>
“There isn’t anything to do,” said Mr. Barrow.
“Captain Crewe is dead. The child is a beggar.
Nobody is responsible for her but you.”</p><p></p><p>
“I will turn her into the street!” cried Miss
Minchin.</p><p></p><p>
“I wouldn’t do that, madam,” he said; “it
wouldn’t look well. This is bad for your school. She’s
a clever child, I believe. She can work for you.”
Mr. Barrow left and Miss Minchin looked at
the door for some time. Miss Amelia came in.
“What has happened, Miss Minchin?” she asked.
Miss Minchin’s voice was angry when she
answered:</p><p></p><p>
“Where is Sara Crewe?”</p><p>
“Sara! Why, she’s with the children in your
room, of course.”</p><p>
“Does she have a black dress?”</p><p>
“A black dress? A BLACK one?”</p><p>
“Go and tell her to wear her black dress. There
will be no more fun. Captain Crewe is dead. He has
died without a penny. That child is on my hands.”
Miss Amelia sat down and cried. Miss Minchin
looked angry when Sara came to her.</p><p>
“Put down your doll,” said Miss Minchin.</p><p>
“No,” Sara answered. “I will not put her down.
She is all I have. My papa gave her to me.”
“You will have no time for dolls in future,”
Miss Minchin said. “You will have to work. Do
you understand me?”</p><p>
“Yes,” answered Sara. “My papa is dead. He
left me no money. I am quite poor.”</p><p>
“You are a beggar,” said Miss Minchin. “You
have no home, and no one to take care of you.”
“I understand,” answered Sara.</p><p>
“You are like Becky--you must work for your
living.”</p><p>
To her surprise, a gleam of hope came into
the child’s eyes.</p><p>
“Can I work?” she said. “If I can work it will
not matter so much. What can I do?”</p><p>
“You speak French well, and you can help with
the younger children. You will run errands and help
in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom. If you
don’t please me, you will go away. Remember that.
Now go.”</p><p>
Sara stood still just a moment, then she turned
to leave the room.</p><p>
“Stop!” said Miss Minchin. “Don’t you want
to thank me?”</p><p>
“What for?” Sara said.</p><p>
“For my kindness to you,” replied Miss Minchin.
“For giving you a home.”</p><p>
Sara made two or three steps toward her.</p><p>
“You are not kind,” she said. “You are NOT
kind, and it is NOT a home.”</p><p>
And she turned and run out of the room before
Miss Minchin could stop her.</p><p>
She wanted to go to her room. But Miss Amelia
stopped her at the door.</p><p>
“You--you are not to go in there,” she said.
“Not go in?” exclaimed Sara.</p><p>
“That is not your room now,” Miss Amelia
answered.</p><p>
“Where is my room?” she asked.</p><p>
“You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky.”
Sara knew where it was. She went to the attic.
Yes, this was another world. The room was old,
small and very dirty. Becky came up to her.</p><p>
“Oh, Becky,” Sara said. “I told you we were
just the same--only two little girls--just two little
girls. You see how true it is. There’s no difference
now. I’m not a princess anymore.”</p><p>
Becky ran to her, hugged her and cried.</p><p>
“Yes, miss, you are, whatever happens to you,
you’d be a princess all the same.”</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 8</h3>
<div>

<p>
The first night she spent in her attic was a thing
Sara never forgot. She was in the darkness. Her
bed wasn’t soft anymore. She heard rats near her
bed. And she felt very sad and lonely in the world.
Next morning changes began. Lavinia sat in
her place in the classroom and her room was for
another pupil. Sara didn’t learn anymore, she helped
little children. The more she worked, the more Miss
Minchin wanted from her. She tried to do her work
well, but nobody became kinder to her. Lavinia was
always glad to do something bad for Sara. Miss
Minchin was very cold and angry.</p><p>
But some people tried to make Sara’s life better.
Becky came to her every morning and helped
her with her dress. Ermengarde had a kind heart
too. She went to her family for some time. When
she came back, she saw that Sara’s life was different.
She came to talk to Sara but she didn’t know
what to say. And Sara thought Miss Minchin told
her not to be friends anymore. Sara stopped talking 
with Ermengarde and turned away from her.</p><p>
Ermengarde was very unhappy and one night she
came to Sara’s room in the attic.</p><p>
“Ermengarde!” cried Sara. “You will get into
trouble.”</p><p>
“But I don’t care--I don’t care a bit. Oh, Sara,
please tell me. What is the matter? Why don’t you
like me anymore?”</p><p>
“I like you,” Sara answered. “I thought--you
see, everything is different now. I thought you--
were different”.</p><p>
Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.</p><p>
“Why, it was you who were different!” she
cried. “You didn’t want to talk to me. I didn’t
know what to do. It was you who were different
after I came back.”</p><p>
“I AM different,” Sara explained, “though not
in the way you think. Miss Minchin does not want
me to talk to the girls. Most of them don’t want
to talk to me. I thought--perhaps--you didn’t. So
I tried to keep out of your way.”</p><p>
“Oh, Sara,” Ermengarde cried and the girls
hugged. They decided to meet in the attic so that
Ermengarde would be able to listen to the stories.
</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 9</h3>
<div>

<p>
Soon Lottie came to see her “mother”. She
climbed the stairs to Sara’s room and was afraid
of it. Sara showed her the windows and the birds
on the roof. And Lottie thought that the room was
very good and wanted to stay there. But when Lottie
left, Sara saw how bad the room was. She became
sad again. So she sat on her bed and decided to
have some bread. Suddenly she heard some noise.
It was a big rat with clever eyes. The rat wanted
some bread crumbs. Sara gave it the crumbs. The
rat ate one and took the others somewhere.</p><p>
“I knew he wanted it for his children,” said
Sara. “I think I could make friends with him.”
One night Sara did not open the door to Ermengarde
for two or three minutes. “There!” Ermengarde
heard her say. “Take it and go home,
Melchisedec! Go home to your wife!”</p><p>
“Who ARE you talking to, Sara?” she asked.
“You must not scream, or I can’t tell you,”
Sara answered.</p><p>
“Is it something that will frighten me?” she
asked.</p><p>
“Some people are afraid of them,” said Sara.
“I was at first but I am not now.”</p><p>
“Was it a ghost?” asked Ermengarde.</p><p>
“No,” said Sara, laughing. “It was my rat.”</p><p>
“Oh! Oh!” she cried. “A rat! A rat!”</p><p>
“He is just like a person. Now watch!”</p><p>
Sara whistled and the rat came. Sara had
some crumbs in her hand. She dropped them, and
Melchisedec came quietly and ate them. He took a
large piece and took it to his home.</p><p>
“You see,” said Sara, “that is for his wife and
children. He is very nice. He only eats the little bits.
After he goes back I can always hear his family
squeaking. There are three kinds of squeaks. One
is the children’s, and one is Mrs. Melchisedec’s,
and one is Melchisedec’s own.”</p><p>
Ermengarde began to laugh.</p><p>
“Oh, Sara!” she whispered. “It is like a story!”</p><p>
“It IS a story,” said Sara. “EVERYTHING’S
a story. You are a story--I am a story. Miss
Minchin is a story.”</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 10</h3>
<div>

<p>
Friendly visits were rare, and Sara lived a strange
and lonely life. She had no one to talk to; and when
she went on errands and walked through the streets,
she felt very lonely. Sara wore her old clothes that
were small for her and she looked strange.</p><p>
There were several families in the square where
Miss Minchin’s school was. Sara liked looking at
the life of these families through the windows. She
made up stories about them. Her favourite family
was a family with eight children. Sara called them
the Large Family or the Montmorencys. They were
all rosy and friendly.</p><p>
One evening a very funny thing happened.
Several of the Montmorencys decided to go to a
children’s party. They left the house to get into
their carriage. Sara wanted to look at them for a
moment. So she stopped.</p><p>
It was Christmas time, and the Large Family
knew many stories about children who were poor.
The boy saw Sara standing near their house. He 
decided to help her. So he put his hand in his
pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her.
“Here, poor little girl,” he said. “Here is a
sixpence. I will give it to you.”</p><p>
Sara started, and all at once understood that
she looked like poor child. Her face went red and
then it went pale, and for a second she felt as if
she could not take the dear little sixpence.
“Oh, no!” she said. “Oh, no, thank you; I
mustn’t take it, indeed!”</p><p>
Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child’s
voice and her manner was so like the manner of a
well-bred little person that the girls of the family
leaned forward to listen.</p><p>
“Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!” the
boy said. “You can buy things to eat with it. It
is a whole sixpence!”</p><p>
There was something so kind in his face that
Sara knew she must not refuse him.</p><p>
“Thank you,” she said. “You are a kind, kind
little darling thing.”</p><p>
The children went away in the carriage and
one of the girls said “Oh, Donald, why did you
give that little girl your sixpence? I’m sure she is
not a beggar.”</p><p>
“She didn’t speak like a beggar!” cried Nora.</p><p>
“And her face didn’t really look like a beggar’s face!”
“She is a servant at the seminary,” Janet said.</p><p>
“I think she is an orphan. But she is not a beggar,
however shabby she looks.”</p><p>
And afterward she had a name with all of them,
“The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar,” which was,
of course, a long name.</p><p>
Sara loved her small pupils, her friends Ermengarde,
Lottie and Becky. She became friends
with Melchisedec and he often came out with his
wife and children. She only felt that Emily was not
her real friend anymore. Sara understood she was
just a doll.</p><p>
Sara saw a beautiful house next door to the
school. She dreamt that one day someone would buy
it. And this day came. Becky said that a rich man
from India came to live in that house. Sara saw
the man some days later. He looked unhappy and
ill. His skin was yellow. His friend was the father
from the Large family. That was the beginning of
the story of the Indian gentleman.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 11</h3>
<div>

<p>
There were fine sunsets even in the square,
sometimes. Sara went to the roof to look at the
evening sky. One day she saw another person on
her roof. It was a Lascar. He stood there with
his pet monkey and enjoyed the sunset too. He
saw Sara and smiled. The monkey jumped from his
hands and ran to Sara. She asked the Lascar in
his language: “Will he let me catch him?”</p><p>
The Lascar was happy to hear Sara’s words.
His name was Ram Dass. He was from India. He
climbed to Sara’s part of the roof. The monkey was
in the room. Ram Dass saw that the room was very
poor and shabby. But he didn’t say a word and
spoke to Sara as if she was a daughter of a rajah.
When Ram Dass left, Sarah began to think
of her life. She knew Miss Minchin wanted her to
work and be a servant.</p><p>
Then a thought came back to her which helped
her. “Whatever comes,” she said, “cannot change
one thing. If I am a princess in shabby clothes, I
can be a princess inside.” Sara said these words to
herself when she had hard days with Miss Minchin.
The morning after the talk with Ram Dass and
his monkey, Sara was in the schoolroom with her
small pupils. She finished her lesson and started
to put away the books. She had a strange face.
Miss Minchin became angry; she ran to Sara and
slapped her. Sara was surprised and she laughed.
“What are you laughing at?” Miss Minchin
cried.</p><p>
“I was thinking,” she answered with red cheeks.
“Say that you are sorry,” said Miss Minchin.</p><p>
Sara thought for a second.</p><p>
“I am sorry for laughing,” she said then; “but
I am not sorry for thinking.”</p><p>
“What were you thinking?” demanded Miss
Minchin. “How dare you think?”</p><p>
The older girls in the classroom laughed. Sara
thought again and answered and her eyes shone
like stars.</p><p>
“I was thinking,” she answered, “that you did
not know what you were doing. And I was thinking
what would happen if I were a princess and you
slapped me, what I should do to you. And I was
thinking how surprised and frightened you would be
if you suddenly found out--”</p><p>
“What?” Miss Minchin cried. “Found out
what?”</p><p>
“That I really was a princess,” said Sara, “and
could do anything-- anything I liked.”</p><p>
Every pair of eyes in the room was looking
at them.</p><p>
“Go to your room,” cried Miss Minchin, “this
second! Leave the schoolroom!”</p><p>
“Excuse me for laughing,” Sara said, and walked
out of the room.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 12</h3>
<div>

<p>
When one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting
to think of the things which happen on 
the other side of the wall. Sara often did it. She
thought about the Indian gentleman and his life. She
liked him as he looked unhappy. The Large family
often visited the gentleman with all their children.
The Indian gentleman’s real name was Mr.</p><p>
Carrisford. One day one of the Montmorencys told
Mr. Carrisford about the little-girl-who-was-not-abeggar.
He was very much interested, and all the
more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the
adventure of the monkey on the roof. Ram Dass
made for him a very clear picture of the dirty attic.
“Carmichael,” he said to the father of the
Large Family, “I wonder how many of the attics in
this square are like that one, and how many little
servant girls sleep on such beds, while I have so
much money, most of it not mine. Do you think it
 is possible that the other child, the child I never
stop thinking of, could live like that?”</p><p>
Mr. Carmichael looked at him. He knew that
the worst thing the man could do for himself, for
his health, was to begin to think about the girl.</p><p>
“If the child at Madame Pascal’s school in
Paris was the one you are looking for,” he answered,
“she is in a good family. They have no
other children, and Madame Pascal said that they
were rich Russians.”</p><p>
“But you say ‘IF the child was the one I am
looking for’. You say ‘if.’ We are not sure. There
was a difference in the name.”</p><p>
“An English officer in India took his motherless
little girl at the school. He died suddenly after losing
his fortune.” Mr. Carmichael paused a moment.</p><p>
“Are you SURE the child was left at a school in
Paris? Are you sure it was Paris?”</p><p>
“My dear friend,” Carrisford said, “I am SURE
of nothing. I never saw the child. Ralph Crewe and
I loved each other as boys. We met many years
later in India. I knew he had a child but we never
spoke about her. We spoke about the mines. I only
knew that the child was at school somewhere. I
do not even remember, now, HOW I knew it. I
thought she could be in Paris because her mother
was French. Carmichael,” he said, “I MUST find
her. If she is alive, she is somewhere”.</p><p>
“Come, come,” said Carmichael. “We will find
her.”</p><p>
“We must. I often see Ralph Crew in my
dreams. He asks me: “Where is my little Missus?”
I must answer him.”</p><p>
On the other side of the wall Sara talked to
Melchisedec.</p><p>
“It has been hard to be a princess today,
Melchisedec,” she said. “It has been harder than
usual. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And
it’s a cold night.”</p><p>
“Oh, papa,” she whispered, “what a long time
it seems since I was your `Little Missus’!”
This was what happened that day on both sides
of the wall.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 13</h3>
<div>

<p>
That winter was very cold. There was often a
strong wind. Sara felt bad in her small clothes, she
couldn’t get warm.</p><p>
Some very strange things happen in this world
sometimes. It certainly was a strange thing that
happened to Sara. She had to cross the street and
she saw something in the mud. It was actually a
piece of silver- a four-penny piece.</p><p>
In one second it was in her cold little redand-
blue hand.</p><p>
“Oh,” she gasped, “it is true! It is true!”
And then she looked at the shop near her. And
it was a baker’s shop. She saw the tasty buns.
It almost made Sara feel faint for a few seconds.
“But I’ll go and ask the baker woman if she
has lost anything,” she said to herself. She went to
the shop and stopped when she saw a beggar-girl.
“Are you hungry?” she asked.</p><p>
The child was very hungry.</p><p>
“If I’m a princess,” she said, “if I’m a princess,
I must share with people.”</p><p>
“Wait a minute,” she said to the beggar child.
She went into the shop.</p><p>
“If you please,” said Sara, “have you lost
fourpence--a silver fourpence?”</p><p>
The woman looked at it and then at her.</p><p>
“Bless us, no,” she answered. “Did you find it?”
“Yes,” said Sara. “In the mud.”</p><p>
“Keep it, then,” said the woman.</p><p>
“I know that,” said Sara, “but I thought I
would ask you.”</p><p>
“Not many would,” said the woman, looking
surprised and interested and good-natured all at
once.</p><p>
“Do you want to buy anything?” she added.
“Four buns, if you please,” said Sara. “A
penny each.”</p><p>
The woman went to the window and put some
in a paper bag. Sara noticed that she put in six.
“I said four, if you please,” she explained. “I
have only fourpence.”</p><p>
“I’ll throw in two,” said the woman with her
good-natured look. “I dare say you can eat them.
Aren’t you hungry?”</p><p>
“Yes,” she answered. “I am very hungry, and
I thank you. And there is a child who is hungrier
than I am.”</p><p>
Sara left the shop and came up to the beggar.
She opened the paper bag and took out one of the
hot buns.</p><p>
“See,” she said, “this is nice and hot. Eat it,
and you will not feel so hungry.”</p><p>
The child ate the bun like a wolf. Sara took
out three more buns and put them down.</p><p>
“She is hungrier than I am,” she said to herself.
But her hand trembled when she put down the
fourth bun. “I’m not very hungry,” she said--and
she put down the fifth.</p><p>
“Good-bye,” said Sara and went to her attic.
At that moment the baker-woman looked out
of her shop window.</p><p>
“Well, I never!” she exclaimed. “If that young
girl hasn’t given her buns to a beggar child.”
She went to the door and spoke to the beggar
child.</p><p>
“Who gave you those buns?” she asked her.</p><p>
The child nodded her head toward Sara.</p><p>
“How many?”</p><p>
“Five.”</p><p>
The woman thought it over.</p><p>
“Left just one for herself,” she said in a low
voice. “And she could eat the whole six--I saw it
in her eyes.”</p><p>
Then she turned to the child.</p><p>
“Are you hungry yet?” she said.</p><p>
“I’m always hungry,” was the answer.</p><p>
“Come in here,” said the woman, and she held
open the shop door. “Get yourself warm. And look
here; when you are very hungry, you can come in
here and ask for it. I’ll help you for the sake of
that girl.”</p><p>
Sara enjoyed her bun. She saw Montmorency
in the carriage. He left for Moscow to look for
some girl.</p><p>
“I wonder who the little girl is,” she thought--
“the little girl he is going to look for.”</p><p>
And she went down the steps, as the father of
the Large Family was on his way to the station to
take the train to Moscow, where he was to make
his best efforts to search for the lost little daughter
of Captain Crewe.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 14</h3>
<div>

<p>
On this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a
strange thing happened in the attic. Only Melchisedec
saw and heard it.</p><p>
Two men were outside on the roof. One was
Ram Dass and the other was a young man who
was the Indian gentleman’s secretary; but of course
Melchisedec did not know this.</p><p>
The secretary saw Melchisedec’s tail.</p><p>
“Was that a rat?” he asked Ram Dass in a
whisper.</p><p>
“Yes; a rat, Sahib,” answered Ram Dass, also
whispering. “There are many in the walls.”</p><p>
“Ugh!” exclaimed the young man. “It is a
wonder the child is not afraid of them.”</p><p>
“The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib,”
he answered. “She is not as other children. I
see her when she does not see me. The rat comes
for crumbs. There is a little child who comes to
her in secret; there is one older who would listen
to her forever if she might.”</p><p>
“You seem to know a lot about her,” the secretary
said.</p><p>
“All her life each day I know,” answered Ram Dass.
“You are sure no one comes near this place but
herself, and that she will not return and surprise
us. She would be frightened if she found us here,
and the Sahib Carrisford’s plan would end.”</p><p>
Ram Dass stood near the door and the secretary
wrote down the details of the room.</p><p>
“It is a strange way of doing the thing,” he
said. “Who planned it?”</p><p>
“It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib,”
Ram Dass said; “I am fond of this child; we
are both lonely. One evening she told her rat about
her dreams. I told Sahib of the girl to please him. It
seemed then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib.
He began to think of making her dreams real.”</p><p>
“You think that we can do it while she sleeps?
“I can move as if my feet were of velvet,” Ram
Dass replied; “and children sleep soundly, even the
unhappy ones.”</p><p>
He smiled as if his heart warmed under his
white robe, and the secretary smiled back at him.
“It will be like a story,” he said.</p><p>
The young secretary seemed interested in
everything. He wrote down things about the floor,
the bed, the old table, the walls.</p><p>
“I think we can go now,” he said. “The Sahib
Carrisford has a warm heart. It is a pity that he
has not found the lost child.”</p><p>
Then the left as quietly as they came.</p>
</div>


<h3>CHAPTER 15</h3>
<div>

<p>
When Sara went into the house she met Miss
Minchin.</p><p>
“Where have you been?” she demanded. “You
have been out for hours.”</p><p>
“It was so wet and muddy,” Sara answered, “it
was hard to walk, because my shoes were so bad.”</p><p>
“Make no excuses,” said Miss Minchin, “and
tell no lies.”</p><p>
Sara went in to the cook.</p><p>
“May I have something to eat?” Sara asked.
“Tea’s over,” was the answer.</p><p>
Sara stood silent for a second.</p><p>
“I had no dinner,” she said.</p><p>
“There’s some bread,” said the cook. “That’s
all you’ll get at this time of day.”</p><p>
Sara went and found the bread. It was old and
dry. She was tired and went to her attic. Ermengarde
was there.</p><p>
“Papa has sent me some more books, Sara,”</p><p>
she said. “There they are.”</p><p>
“Look here,” Sara cried, “if you lend me these
books, I’ll read them and tell you everything that’s
in them.</p><p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Ermengarde. “Do you think
you can?”</p><p>
“I know I can,” Sara answered. “The little ones
always remember what I tell them.”</p><p>
“Sara,” said Ermengarde, with hope in her round
face, “if you do that, and make me remember, I’ll
give you anything.”</p><p>
“I don’t want you to give me anything,” said
Sara. “I want your books—I want them!” And her
eyes grew big.</p><p>
“Oh, Sara!” said Ermengarde. “This very afternoon
my nicest aunt sent me a box. It is full of
good things. I never touched it. It’s got cake in it,
and little meat pies, and jam tarts and buns, and
oranges and figs and chocolate. I’ll go back to my
room and get it this minute, and we’ll eat it now.”
Sara was happy.</p><p>
“Do you think--you COULD?” she asked.</p><p>
“I know I could,” answered Ermengarde, and
she ran to the door.</p><p>
Sara and Becky decorated the attic room. They
found some tablecloth and plates. Sara thought it
looked like a great party.</p><p>
“Doesn’t it LOOK real?” she said. “Now we
will begin the party.”</p><p>
She led the way to the table. She was in her
dream. They didn’t have time to take their pieces of
cake into their hands, not one of them had time to
do more, when they all three jumped to their feet
and turned pale faces toward the door-- listening-
-listening.</p><p>
Someone was coming up the stairs. There was
no mistake about it.</p><p>
“It’s--the missus!” whispered Becky, and
dropped her piece of cake upon the floor.
“Yes,” said Sara, her eyes growing shocked and
large in her small white face. “Miss Minchin has
found us out.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin opened the door. She was pale.
She looked from the frightened faces to the table.
“Lavinia has told the truth!” she exclaimed. She
slapped Becky and cried: “Go to your attic!”
Then it was Sara’s turn again.</p><p>
“I will talk to you tomorrow. You will have no
breakfast, dinner or supper!”</p><p>
“I have not had either dinner or supper today,
Miss Minchin,” said Sara.</p><p>
“Then all the better. You will have something
to remember. Don’t stand there.”</p><p>
“And you”--to Ermengarde--“have brought your
beautiful new books into this dirty attic. Take them
up and go back to bed. You will stay there all day
tomorrow, and I will write to your papa. What
would HE say if he knew where you are tonight?”
Something she saw in Sara’s face at this moment
made her turn on her fiercely.</p><p>
“What are you thinking of?” she demanded.
“Why do you look at me like that?”</p><p>
“I was wondering,” answered Sara.</p><p>
“What were you wondering?”</p><p>
“I was wondering,” she said in a sad and quiet
voice, “what MY papa would say if he knew where
I am tonight.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin was very angry. She flew at her
and shook her. “How dare you! How dare you!”
She picked up the books and pushed Ermengarde
to the door. The door closed and Sara was alone.
She suddenly felt so tired, perhaps because she
was hungry, that she sat down on the bed.
“Suppose there was a bright fire in the room,
with,” she whispered. “Suppose there was a comfortable
chair before it--and suppose there was a
small table near, with a little hot—hot supper on it.
And suppose this was a beautiful soft bed. Suppose--
suppose--” And her eyes closed and she
fell fast asleep.</p><p>
She did not know how long she slept. At first
she did not open her eyes. She felt too sleepy and
too warm and comfortable.</p><p>
“What a nice dream!” she murmured. “I feel
quite warm. I--don’t- -want- -to--wake--up.”
Of course it was a dream. She felt as if warm,
delightful bedclothes were upon her. She could actually
FEEL blankets. It was a sense of light, and a
sound--the sound of a crackling, roaring little fire.
“Oh, I am waking up,” she said. “I can’t help
it--I can’t.”</p><p>
Her eyes opened in spite of herself. And then
she actually smiled—for what she saw was a surprise.
“Oh, I HAVEN’T woken up,” she whispered.</p><p>
“I am dreaming yet.” She knew it MUST be a
dream. She was in the room of her dreams. And
it all happened at night.</p><p>
“It does not go away,” she gasped, “Oh, I
have never had such a dream before.”</p><p>
She touched all the things in her room. “They
are real. It’s all real!” she cried. “I am NOT--I
am NOT dreaming!”</p><p>
She ran to the books and opened the one which
was on top. There were some words:</p><p>
“To the little girl in the attic. From a friend.”
When she saw that, she cried for the first time
in many days.</p><p>
“I don’t know who it is,” she said; “but somebody
cares for me a little. I have a friend.”</p><p>
She took her candle and went out of her own
room and into Becky’s, and stood by her bed.</p><p>
“Becky, Becky!” she whispered as loudly as she
dared. “Wake up!”</p>
</div>



<h3>CHAPTER 16</h3>
<div>

<p>
The girls had a wonderful breakfast. There was
hot tea and soup with buns. Sara went down with
a smile on her face. The girls and Miss Minchin
were surprised. Sara thought about her room all day
long. She was afraid that all the things were just
her dream. But in the evening her room became
even better. There were a lot of beautiful pictures
and figures. And every day something changed
and there were new things in the room. Sara felt
stronger every day.</p><p>
In a very short time she began to look less
thin. Color came into her cheeks, and her eyes did
not seem so much too big for her face.</p><p>
Then another wonderful thing happened. A man
came to the door and left several parcels. All were
addressed in large letters, “To the Little Girl in the
right-hand attic.”</p><p>
Sara herself opened the door and took them in.
“Take the things to the young lady to whom
they belong,” Miss Minchin said.</p><p>
“They belong to me,” answered Sara, quietly.
“To you?” exclaimed Miss Minchin. “What do
you mean?”</p><p>
“I don’t know where they come from,” said
Sara, “but they are for me. I sleep in the righthand
attic. Becky has the other one.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin came to her side and looked at
the parcels.</p><p>
“What is in them?” she asked.</p><p>
“I don’t know,” replied Sara.</p><p>
“Open them,” she said.</p><p>
There were a lot of beautiful and expensive
clothes and shoes. There were even a nice hat
and an umbrella. They were all good and expensive
things. Miss Minchin thought that Sara might have
some rich relatives.</p><p>
“Well,” she said, “someone is very kind to you.
Learn your lessons in the classroom. You don’t need
to work today.”</p><p>
When Sara came into the classroom , she looked
good. The girls were surprised and Lavinia became
jealous again.</p><p>
Sara wanted to thank her secret friend and she
wanted to write him a letter. “I can write to him,”
she said, “and leave it on the table. Then perhaps
the person who takes the things away will take it,
too. I won’t ask him anything.”</p><p>
So she wrote a note. This is what she said:</p><p>********************</p><p>

“I am so grateful to you, and I am so happy--</p><p>
and so is Becky. Becky feels just as grateful as</p><p>
I do--it is all just as beautiful and wonderful</p><p>
to her as it is to me. We used to be so lonely</p><p>
and cold and hungry, and now--oh, just think</p><p>
what you have done for us! Please let me say</p><p>
just these words. It seems as if I must say them.</p><p>
Thank you--Thank you—Thank you!</p><p>

The little girl in the attic”.</p><p>********************</p><p>

Next morning there was no letter on the table.</p><p>
Sara was happy. She knew that her friend was
glad to get it.</p><p>
In the evening the girls heard a sound. It wasn’t
Melchisedec or a cat. Sara went to look what it was.
“It is the monkey,” she cried out. “He has left
Lascar’s attic, and he saw us.”</p><p>
Becky ran to her side.</p><p>
“Are you going to let him in, miss?” she said.
“Yes,” Sara answered joyfully. “It’s too cold
for monkeys to be out.”</p><p>
“Come along, monkey, darling,” she said. “I
won’t hurt you.”</p><p></p><p>
“What will you do with him?” Becky asked.</p><p>
“I will let him sleep with me tonight, and then
take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow. I
am sorry to take you back, monkey; but you must
go. You must be fond of your own family; and I’m
not a REAL relative.”</p><p>
And when she went to bed she made him a
nest at her feet, and he slept there as if he were
a baby.</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 17</h3>
<div>

<p>
The next afternoon three children of the Large
Family sat in the Indian gentleman’s library, doing
their best to cheer him up. Janet, Nora and
Donald talked and waited for the news about the
girl. Their father arrived later.</p><p>
“What news?” Mr. Carrisford asked.
“She is not the child we are looking for,” was
Mr. Carmichael’s answer. “She is much younger
than Captain Crewe’s little girl. Her name is Emily
Carew. I have seen and talked to her.”</p><p>
How sad the Indian gentleman looked!</p><p>
“We have to begin again!” he said. “That is
all. Please sit down.”</p><p>
“Come, come,” Mr. Carmichael said; “we’ll
find her yet.”</p><p>
“We must begin at once. We have no time,”
Mr. Carrisford said. “Have you got any new ideas?”
“We have been to the schools in Paris. Let us
begin in London. That was my idea.”</p><p>
“There are many schools in London,” said Mr.
Carrisford. “By the way, there is one next door.”
“Then we will begin there. We cannot begin
nearer than next door.”</p><p>
“No,” said Carrisford. “There is a child there
who interests me; but she is not a pupil.”
Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that
very moment—the beautiful Magic. Ramm Dass came
into the room.</p><p>
“Sahib,” he said, “the child herself has come-
-the child the sahib felt pity for. She brings back
the monkey. I have asked that she remain. It was
my thought that it would please the sahib to see
and speak with her.”</p><p>
“Who is she?”asked Mr. Carmichael.</p><p>
“God knows,” Mr. Carrrisford answered. “She
is the child I spoke of.”</p><p>
He addressed Ram Dass. “Yes, I would like to
see her. Go and bring her in.”</p><p>
Then he turned to Mr. Carmichael. “While
you have been away,” he explained, “I have been
desperate. The days were so dark and long. Ram
Dass told me of this child’s miseries, and together
we made up a romantic plan to help her. I suppose
it was a childish thing to do; but it gave me
something to plan and think of.”</p><p>
Then Sara came into the room.</p><p>
“Your monkey ran away again,” she said. “He
came to me last night, and I took him in because
it was so cold.”</p><p>
Sara looked at Ram Dass, who stood near the
door.</p><p>
“Shall I give him to the Lascar?” she asked.
“How do you know he is a Lascar?” said the
Indian gentleman, smiling a little.</p><p>
“Oh, I know Lascars,” Sara said. “I was born
in India.”</p><p>
The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly,
and with such a change of his face, that she was
for a moment quite scared.</p><p>
“You were born in India,” he exclaimed, “were
you? Come here.”</p><p>
Sara went to him.</p><p>
“Do you live next door?” he asked.</p><p>
“Yes; I live at Miss Minchin’s seminary.”</p><p>
“But you are not one of her pupils?”</p><p>
Sara smiled a bit.</p><p>
“I don’t think I know WHAT I am,” she
answered.</p><p>
“Why not?”</p><p>
“At first I was a pupil; but now--”</p><p>
“You were a pupil! What are you now?”</p><p>
“I sleep in the attic”, she said. “I run errands
for the cook--I do anything she tells me; and I
teach the little ones their lessons.”</p><p>
“Ask her, Carmichael,” said Mr. Carrisford.</p><p>
“Ask her; I cannot.”</p><p>
The big, kind father of the Large Family knew
how to ask little girls.</p><p>
“What do you mean by `At first,’ my child?”
he asked.</p><p>
“When my papa took me here.”</p><p>
“Where is your papa?”</p><p>
“He died,” said Sara, very quietly. “He lost all
his money and there was none for me. There was
no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin.”
“How did your father lose his money?” the
Indian gentleman asked.</p><p>
“He did not lose it himself,” Sara answered.
“He had a friend --he was very fond of him. It
was his friend who took his money”.</p><p>
“It was a mistake,” the gentleman said. “What
was your father’s name? Tell me.”</p><p>
“His name was Ralph Crewe,” Sara answered.
“Captain Crewe. He died in India.”</p><p>
“Carmichael,” the man said fainting, “it is the
child--the child!”</p><p>
For a moment Sara thought he was going to
die. Ram Dass gave him some water.</p><p>
“What child am I?” Sara whispered.</p><p>
“He was your father’s friend,” Mr. Carmichael
answered her. “Don’t be frightened. We have been
looking for you for two years.”</p><p>
Sara spoke as if she were in a dream.</p><p>
“And I was at Miss Minchin’s all the time,”
she whispered. “Just on the other side of the wall.”</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER 18</h3>
<div>

<p>
The Large family explained everything to Sara.
Mrs. Carmichael told her the story of the mines.
Sara could only think of one thing.</p><p>
“Was he,” she said, “was HE the bad friend?</p><p>
Oh, tell me!”</p><p>
Mrs. Carmichael cried and kissed her.</p><p>
“He was not bad, my dear,” she answered.</p><p>
“He did not really lose your papa’s money. He
only thought he lost it; and because he loved him
so much, he became ill. And then your papa died.”</p><p>
“And he did not know where to find me,”</p><p>
whispered Sara. “And I was so near.”</p><p>
“And he thought you were in France. When
he saw you in the school, he wanted to help you,
because you were a little girl, he was sorry for
you, and wanted to make you happier. And he told
Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try
to make you comfortable.”</p><p>
Sara was very happy.</p><p>
“Did Ram Dass bring the things?” she cried
out. “Did he tell Ram Dass to do it? Did he make
the dream that came true?”</p><p>
“Yes, my dear--yes! He is kind and good, and he
was sorry for you, for little lost Sara Crewe’s sake.”
“I am glad I need not go back,” said Sara.</p><p>
“Miss Minchin will be very angry. She does not
like me.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin came to the house herself. She
entered the room. She was very polite.</p><p>
“I am sorry, Mr. Carrisford,” she said; “I am
Miss Minchin from the Young Ladies’ Seminary
next door.”</p><p>
The Indian gentleman looked at her for a moment.
“So you are Miss Minchin?” he said.</p><p>
“I am, sir.”</p><p>
“In that case,” the Indian gentleman replied,
“you have come at the right time. Mr. Carmichael
was going to see you.”</p><p>
“I do not understand. I have come here to take
my pupil.” She turned to Sara.</p><p>
“Go home at once,” she said.</p><p>
“She is not going.” said the gentleman
“Not going!” she exclaimed.</p><p>
“No,” said Mr. Carrisford. “She is not going
home if you give your house that name. Her home
for the future will be with me.”</p><p>
“With YOU! With YOU sir! What does this mean?”
“Kindly explain it to her, Carmichael,” said
the Indian gentleman; “and get it over as quickly
as possible.</p><p>
“Mr. Carrisford, madam,” Mr. Carmichael said,
“was a friend of Captain Crewe. He was his partner.
Now he has her fortune.”</p><p>
“The fortune!” cried Miss Minchin. “Sara’s
fortune!”</p><p>
“It WILL be Sara’s,” answered Mr. Carmichael,
rather coldly. “The diamond mines were true.”
“The diamond mines!” Miss Minchin cried. She
felt horrible.</p><p>
“The diamond mines,” Mr. Carmichael said,
“There are not many princesses, Miss Minchin,
who are richer than your little pupil.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin was not a clever woman and she
tried to return Sara to school.</p><p>
“I have done everything for her. Or she could
die in the streets. She must learn.”</p><p>
“Come, come, Miss Minchin,” Mr. Carmichael said,
“If Sara wants to stay in your school, she will do it.”
“Then,” said Miss Minchin, “Sara, come back
to school. Your papa chose it for you. I have
always loved you.”</p><p>
Sara looked at her.</p><p>
“Have YOU, Miss Minchin?” she said. “I did
not know that. You know why I will never return
to your school.”</p><p>
Miss Minchin was very angry and she left.</p><p>
That evening Ermengarde came to the schoolroom
with a letter in her hand
“What has happened?” cried two or three girls.
Ermengarde answered them slowly.</p><p>
“I have just had this letter from Sara,” she said.
“From Sara! Where is she?”</p><p>
“Next door,” said Ermengarde, “with the Indian
gentleman.”</p><p>
“Where? Where? Does Miss Minchin know?</p><p>
Why did she write? Tell us! Tell us!”</p><p>
“There WERE diamond mines,” Ermengarde
said; “there WERE! They were real. It was all
a mistake about them. Something happened for a
time, and Mr. Carrisford thought they were not…”
“Who is Mr. Carrisford?”</p><p>
“The Indian gentleman. And Captain Crewe
thought so, too--and he died; and Mr. Carrisford
was ill and ran away, and HE almost died. And he
did not know where Sara was. And it turned out
that there were millions and millions of diamonds
in the mines; and half of them belong to Sara; and
they belonged to her when she was living in the attic
with no one but Melchisedec for a friend. And Mr.
Carrisford found her this afternoon, and he has got
her in his home--and she will never come back--and
she will be more a princess than she ever was--a
hundred and fifty thousand times more.</p><p>
Becky was happy for Sara but she was sad
to lose her friend. She went to the attic. She saw
Ramm Dass there.</p><p>
“Missee sahib remembered,” he said. “She told
the sahib all. Come tomorrow. You will help Missee.”
And he left.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 19</h3>
<div>

<p>
There never were such friends as Sara and
John Carrisford became. He gave her little presents.
They often talked in the evening. And Lottie and
Ermengarde often came to visit them.</p><p>
One evening, Mr. Carrisford asked Sara.</p><p>
“What are you thinking of?”</p><p>
Sara looked up and said
“I remember one hungry day and a child I saw.”</p><p>
Then she told him the story of the bun shop,
and the fourpence she found in the mud, and the
child who was hungrier than herself.</p><p>
“And I have a plan,” she said.</p><p>
“What is it?” said Mr. Carrisford. “You may
do anything you like to do, princess.”</p><p>
“I have so much money. This woman can give
bread to poor children. I will pay for it later. Could
I do that?”</p><p>
“You will do it tomorrow morning,” said the
Indian gentleman.</p><p>
“Thank you,” said Sara. “You see, I know what
it is to be hungry.”</p><p>
“Yes, yes, my dear,” said the Indian gentleman.
“Try to forget it. Come and sit near me, and only
remember you are a princess.”</p><p>
Next morning they went to the baker’s shop.
The woman smiled.</p><p>
“I’m sure that I remember you, miss,” she
said. “And yet--”</p><p>
“Yes,” said Sara; “once you gave me six buns
for fourpence, and ..”</p><p>
“And you gave five of them to a beggar child,”
the woman said.</p><p>
“I am better now,” said Sara. “And--I am
much happier-- and I have come to ask you to
do something for me.”</p><p>
“Me, miss!” said the bun-woman smiling. “Yes,
miss. What can I do?”</p><p>
And Sara told the woman about her plan. She
promised to help poor children. She told Sara that
she helped the beggar child a lot.</p><p>
“Oh, have you seen her since then?” exclaimed
Sara. “Do you know where she is?”</p><p>
“Yes, I do,” answered the woman, “I’ve given
her home, and she helps me, and she is a good girl.
Her name’s Anne.”</p><p>
“I am so glad,” Sara said.</p><p>
And Sara felt that she understood her. She went
out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, they got
into their carriage and went away.</p>

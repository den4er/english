<h2>"ENGLISH LEGENDS"</h2>

<h3><span>Chapter 1</span> in which Uther Pendragon fell in love
with lady Igraine, a wife of another
man, Merlin helped Uther have what he
wanted, and Uther and Igraine had a
child by the name of Arthur</h3>
<div>


<p>
It was in the days of Uther Pendragon,
when he was king of all England,
that there was a mighty duke in
Cornwall that held war against him for
a long time. That duke was called the
Duke of Tintagil. One time king Uther
sent for this duke, asking him to bring
his wife with him, because she was
known to be a fair and wise lady, and
her name was Igraine.</p><p>
When the duke and his wife came
to the king, the great lords that were 
in the king’s council helped them make
peace. The king liked Igraine very much,
and fell in love with her, and desired
to lay with her. But she was a good
woman, and did not accept the king’s
offer. She came to her husband the
duke and said, “I suppose that we were
sent for so that I be dishonored. I advise
you that we depart from here immediately,
and ride all night to our
own castle.” She also said that it would
be wise to not tell the king and the
lords that they were leaving.</p><p>
So they departed. When king Uther
learned that they left, he was very angry.
He called his council and told the
lords that the Duke of Tintagil rode
away with Igraine. They advised the
king to send for the duke and his wife
to catch them and call them back, and
if they didn’t want to come back, then
the king had a reason to start a war
against them.
</p><p>
They sent the messengers, and the
messengers caught the duke and his
wife midway. The duke said that neither
 he nor his wife would come back.
King Uther was very angry to hear
that message. He sent the messengers
again to warn the duke that he should
prepare for a war, and that in less
than forty days, Uther would take his
biggest castle from him.</p><p>
When the duke heard this warning,
he started to prepare his castles for
war. The duke had two strong castles,
the bigger one was called Terrabil, and
the smaller one was called Tintagil.</p><p>
The duke put his wife Igraine in the
castle of Tintagil, and he put himself
in the castle of Terrabil, which had
many secret exits and passageways.
Then in all haste came Uther with a
great army, and laid a siege to the
castle of Terrabil. And there was a
great war, and many people were slain.</p><p>
But then Uther fell sick, because of
his anger and his love to Igraine. A
noble knight named Sir Ulfius came to
king Uther and asked why he was sick.</p><p>

“I will tell you,” said the king, “I
am sick because of anger and love to
fair Igraine.”</p><p>
“Well, my lord,” said Sir Ulfius, “I
will find Merlin, and he will prepare
a remedy that will cure you.” So Ulfius
departed, and after great adventures
he met Merlin.</p><p>
“Who are you seeking?” Merlin asked
him.</p><p>
Sir Ulfius took a little pause to
think.</p><p>
“I will tell you who you are seeking,”
said Merlin. “You are seeking
Merlin, and you should seek no further,
because I am he. If King Uther
rewards me, and swears to do exactly
as I say, I will give him what he wants
so much.”</p><p>
“I can promise you,” said Sir Ulfius,
“that he will reward you and do
as you ask, as long as you ask reasonable
things of him.”</p><p>
“Ride back to Uther,” said Merlin,
“And I will not be long behind.”</p><p>

Ulfius was glad to hear that, and
rode in all haste back to king Uther
Pendragon, and told him that he had
met Merlin.</p><p>
“Where is he?” said the king.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Ulfius, “He will be here
soon.”</p><p>
As he said that, he saw that Merlin
was standing at the entrance to the
pavilion. Then Merlin came to the king,
and when the king saw him, he said
he was welcome.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “I know what
you wish with all your heart, so if you
swear to me as a king that you will
do as I say, you will have what you
wish.”</p><p>
The king swore on the Four Evangelists.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “This is what I
want from you: the first night that
you will lie with Igraine, you will conceive
a child. When this child is born, 
he will be delivered to me to nourish.
This will bring great glory to you and
your child, if he proves worth it.”</p><p>
“Let it be so,” said Uther. “You
will have the child.”</p><p>
“Get ready,” said Merlin, “Tonight
you will lie with Igraine in the castle
of Tintagil. You will look like her husband
the duke, Sir Ulfius will look like
Sir Brastias, one of the duke’s knights,
and I will look like Sir Jordanus, another
of the duke’s knights. Do not
talk a lot with her nor her men, just
say that you are sick. Go to bed, and
rise in the early morning, and I will
come to bring you back.”</p><p>
They rode to the castle of Tintagil.
The duke saw them depart from the
siege of Terrabil, so came out to fight
with the king’s men. That night he
was killed even before Uther came to
Tintagil.</p><p>

After the death of the duke, king
Uther laid with Igraine, looking like 
the duke three hours after the duke
was dead. In the early morning Merlin
came to Uther to take him back.
Uther kissed lady Igraine and departed
in all haste.</p><p>
When the lady heard that her husband
the duke was killed that night,
she wondered, who came to her chambers
looking like the duke. She mourned
privately, but didn’t tell anybody. Soon,
the lords of king Uther asked him to
end the war between him and Igraine.
He was happy to do that, and he made
Sir Ulfius to be the messenger.</p><p>
“Now we will do well,” said Ulfius.</p><p>
“Our king is a strong man, and he
doesn’t have a wife, and my lady Igraine
is a fair lady. It would be great
joy for us all and it might please the
king to make her his queen.”</p><p>
So king Uther took Igraine as a wife
and made her his queen.</p><p>
But the queen was pregnant, and
soon everyone could see that. So the
king came to her and asked who the
 father of the child was. She didn’t
want to tell him.</p><p>

“Tell me the truth,” said the king,
“And I promise I will love you even
more after that.”</p><p>
“I will tell you the truth,” said Igraine.</p><p>
“The same night my lord was
killed, a man came to me at the castle
of Tintagil, and he looked exactly
like my lord, and with him were two
men looking like my lord’s knights Sir
Brastias and Sir Jordanus. So I went
into bed with him, as I should have
with my lord, and that night we conceived
a child.”</p><p>
“You’re telling me the truth,” said
Uther, “Because it was I who came to
lay with you that night. And I am the
father of the child.” And he told her
how all of that happened as Merlin
planned. She was happy to know that
Uther was the father.</p><p>
Soon Merlin came to the king.</p><p>
“Sir,” he said, “You swore that
you would give the child to me to
nourish.”</p><p>

“As you wish,” Uther said.</p><p>
“I know a lord of yours in this
land,” said Merlin, “his name is Sir
Ector, and he is a true and faithful
knight, and he owns many parts in
England and Wales. Send for him, and
tell him that in the name of his love
to you, he should put his own child
to nourishing of another woman, and
that your child should be nourished by
Sir Ector’s wife. And when the child
is born, have him secretly brought to
me unchristened, through the back door
of the castle.”</p><p>
Uther did as Merlin said. He called
Sir Ector, and granted him great rewards.
Sir Ector swore to do as the
king told him. When the child was
born, Uther commanded two knights
and two ladies to bring the child, bound
in a cloth of gold, through the back
door of the castle and give him to the
poor man they meet outside. So the
child was brought to Merlin, and Merlin
took him to Sir Ector and brought a 
priest to christen the child, and he
called him Arthur.</p><p>
And Sir Ector’s wife nourished the
child as her own.</p>
</div>

<h3><span>Chapter 2</span> in which Uther Pendragon died,
Arthur pulled a sword from a stone
and became King</h3>
<div>

<p>
Two years after Arthur was born,
king Uther Pendragon fell gravely sick.
Meanwhile a great deal of his enemies
gathered forces against him, and started
a great battle, and slain many of
his people.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “You cannot win
a war lying here sick; you should go
to the field of battle. Even if you have
to ride in a horse-litter, but you must
be there in person, and then will you
have your victory.”</p><p>
Uther did like Merlin told him. He
gathered his men and, travelling in a
horse-litter, led them to battle. And
that day Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias 
did many great deeds of arms, and
king Uther’s men won the battle and
slain many of his enemies. And then
Uther returned to London and made
great joy of his victory.</p><p>
But then he was even more sick.
For three days and three nights he
couldn’t talk, so his lords and barons
were in great sorrow and asked for
Merlin’s counsel.</p><p>
“There is no cure for that,” said
Merlin, “It is in the hands of God. But
come to Uther tomorrow morning, and
God and I will make him speak.”
The next morning all the lords and
barons came with Merlin to Uther’s
chamber.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “Is it your will
that after your death your son Arthur
will become king of this realm?”
Then Uther Pendragon turned so
that everybody could see him and spoke.</p><p>

“I give him God’s blessing and mine”,
he said, “and bid him pray for my
soul, and righteously and worshipfully 
claim the crown, or he will lose my
blessing.”</p><p>
Having said that, he yielded up the
ghost, and then he was buried as a
king should be. The queen Igraine
made great sorrow, and with her all
the barons.</p><p>
Then a troubled time came to the
kingdom. No one knew about Arthur,
and everybody was thinking that they
could start a war and claim the crown
for their own. Then Merlin went to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and counseled
him to send for all the lords of
the realm, and all the knights, so that
they would come to London by Christmas.
And since Jesus was born on that
night, as a merciful king of mankind,
he would show some miracle to reveal
who should be the rightful king of this
realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of
Merlin, sent for all the lords and
knights, asking them to come to London
by Christmas. So on Christmas, in 
the greatest church of London, everybody
came to pray. And when matins
and the first mass were done, everybody
could see in the churchyard across
the altar a great stone, and in the middle
of it stood an anvil of steel a foot
on high, and there was a sword between
the stone and the anvil. And letters
that were written in gold about
the sword said this: “Who pulls this
sword out of this stone and anvil, is
the rightful king of all England.”</p><p>

The people told it to the Archbishop,
but he forbade trying to take the
sword out before the Christmas high
mass was finished. After that, a great
many knights and lords tried to get
the sword, but no one could move it.
“He who could pull the sword is not
here,” finally said the Archbishop, “but
God will make him known. But this is
my counsel that we let ten honourable
knights guard the stone at all times.” 
So they put ten knights to guard
the stone at all times, and sent criers
all over the realm to say that everyone
is welcome to come to the church
on New Year’s Eve to try and take the
sword. On that day, a big jousting
tournament was held, so all the barons
and knights went there. Sir Ector
decided to come as well, bringing with
him his son Sir Kay that was made
knight shortly before that, and his
nourished brother Arthur. When they
were riding to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay
noticed that he had forgotten his sword
at home. He asked young Arthur to go
and bring this sword to him, because
he wanted to fight in the tournament.
Arthur went back, but everybody
left home, so he could not get in and
bring Sir Kay’s sword. He didn’t want
to come back with empty hands, because
he didn’t want his brother to
miss the tournament.</p><p>
“I know a sword nearby,” thought
Arthur, “that I can bring to Sir Kay 
so that he would have a sword to fight
with.”</p><p>
So Arthur went to the churchyard.
No one was guarding the stone and the
anvil, because all the knights went to
the tournament. Arthur took the sword
by the handles and easily pulled it from
under the anvil.</p><p>
“Now I have a good sword for Sir
Kay,” he said.</p><p>
So Arthur brought the sword to his
brother. Sir Kay immediately recognized
the sword. He came to Sir Ector
and said, “See, father, this is the
sword from the stone. Therefore I am
the rightful king of this land.”
Sir Ector recognized the sword, too.
He took Arthur and Sir Kay back to
the church, and asked Sir Kay to swear
on the Book and answer, where did he
get the sword.</p><p>
“My brother Arthur gave it to me,”
said Sir Kay.</p><p>
“How did you get this sword?” Sir
Ector asked Arthur.</p><p>

“Sir, I will tell you,” Arthur replied.</p><p>
“When I came home, I saw that
no one was there, so I couldn’t get Sir
Kay’s sword. I didn’t want him to miss
the tournament, so I came here and
pulled this sword from the stone without
any trouble.”</p><p>
“Did you see any knights guarding
the sword?” Sir Ector asked.</p><p>
“No,” Arthur said.</p><p>
“Now,” said Sir Ector to Arthur, “I
understand that you must be the rightful
king of this land.”</p><p>
“Why me?” said Arthur.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Sir Ector, “It is the will
of God, because the man that can pull
this sword from the stone should be the
rightful king of this land. Now let me
see if you can put the sword back into
the stone and then pull it out again.”</p><p>
“With ease,” said Arthur, and put
the sword back into stone.</p><p>
Sir Ector tried pulling the sword
out, but couldn’t, and neither could
Sir Kay. Then Arthur pulled it out 
again with ease. Sir Ector and Sir Kay
kneeled before Arthur.</p><p>
“Alas,” said Arthur, “my dear father
and brother, why do you kneel
before me?”</p><p>
“No, lord Arthur, it is not so,” said
Sir Ector, “I was never your father,
and you are not of my blood, but of
higher blood that I thought.”</p><p>
And then Sir Ector told him everything,
how king Uther asked him to
nourish a child as his own, how Arthur
was secretly taken to him, and
how it did all happen just as Merlin
had said.</p><p>
Then they called the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and told him everything.
The Archbishop called, as Merlin had
told him, a few trusted knights to
guard Arthur day and night, so that
he wouldn’t be killed. Those were Sir
Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius,
Sir Brastias, and many more
with them. He then sent messengers
to summon the barons to London on
Easter.</p><p>

When the Easter day came, the Archbishop
called all the knights and barons,
and in front of them, Arthur put
the sword back to stone, and then no
one could take it out, and then Arthur
took it out again with ease.</p><p>
“So this is the rightful king of this
realm, by the will of God and the law
of men.”</p><p>
And then everybody kneeled at once
before Arthur, both rich and poor, and
asked Arthur for mercy because they
had delayed him so long, and Arthur
forgave them, and took the sword between
both his hands, and offered it
upon the altar where the Archbishop
was, and so was he made knight of
the best man that was there.</p><p>
And so the coronation was made.
There Arthur swore to his lords and
the commons to be a true king, to
stand with true justice from that day
to the end of this life. Many complaints
were made to Sir Arthur about great
evil things that were done since the
death of King Uther, of many lands 
that were taken from lords, knights,
ladies, and gentlemen. So King Arthur
made it so that the lands were given
back to people that owned them.</p><p>
After that the king made officers.
He made Sir Kay seneschal of England;
and Sir Baudwin of Britain was made
constable; and Sir Ulfius was made
chamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made
to guard the northern passes, because
that was where most of the king’s enemies
came from.</p>
</div>

<h3><span>Chapter 3</span> in which Arthur defeated all the kings
who didn’t want to acknowledge his
rule, got himself a queen and
the Round Table</h3>
<div>

<p>
After he was crowned, King Arthur
made it known through criers
that he was preparing a big feast at
Pentecost at the city of Carlion. To
the feast came King Lot of Lothian
and of Orkney, with five hundred
knights with him. Also there came to
the feast King Uriens of Gore with
four hundred knights with him. Also
there came to that feast King Nentres
of Garlot, with seven hundred
knights with him. Also there came to
the feast the king of Scotland with
six hundred knights with him, and he
was but a young man. Also there came 
to the feast a king that was called
the King with the Hundred Knights,
but he and his men had very good
weapons and armor. Also there came
the king of Carados with five hundred
knights.</p><p>
King Arthur was glad to see them,
because he thought that they came to
show him respect and to join his feast.
The king was very happy and sent great
presents to those kings and knights.
But the kings didn’t take the gifts,
and sent the messengers back, saying
that they had no joy in receiving gifts
from a beardless boy that came from
low blood. They also said that they
wouldn’t take his gifts, but instead
came to deliver him the gift of their
own: with hard swords between the
neck and the shoulders. They didn’t
believe in Arthur’s rights to the throne,
and came to save a noble realm from
such a young and simple boy.</p><p>
Following the advice of his barons,
king Arthur took five hundred knights
and went to live in a strong tower.
</p><p>
The kings and the knights laid siege
to that tower, but Arthur and his men
had lots of supplies that would last
them long.</p><p>
After fifteen days, Merlin came to
the city of Carlion. All the kings were
glad to see him, and asked him this.
“For what cause is that boy Arthur
made king?” they asked.</p><p>
“Sirs,” said Merlin, “I shall tell you
the cause. He is King Uther Pendragon’s
son, rightfully born from Igraine,
the duke’s wife of Tintagil.”</p><p>
“Then he is a bastard,” said the
kings. “And has no claim to the throne.”</p><p>
“That is not so,” Merlin answered.</p><p>
“After the death of the duke, more
than after three hours, Arthur was conceived.
And in thirteen days after that
King Uther wed Igraine, so that proves
that he is no bastard and a rightful
heir to the throne. And he will overcome
anybody who says no to that, he
will either slay them, or make them 
serve him. He will be king of all England,
and with that he will have Wales,
Ireland, and Scotland, and many more
realms that I will not name.”
Some of the kings believed Merlin’s
words, some of them laughed at
him, for instance, King Lot, and
some other men called Merlin a witch.
What they did agree on was that
King Arthur should come out from
his tower and speak with the kings,
and they guaranteed his safety. So
Merlin went to Arthur and told him
what he should do.</p><p>
“Come out boldly and speak with
them like their king and ruler,” said
Merlin. “They will not harm you this
time, and after that you will defeat
those of them who do not pledge their
loyalty to you.”</p><p>

So Arthur put on a chainmail under
his gown, and came out and spoke
to the kings harshly, like their king
and ruler. Some of the kings and the
 knights appreciated his confidence, but
others were very angry that such a
young man with so few knights by his
side spoke to them this way. Strong
words were said from the both sides.
After that Arthur returned to his tower
and started preparing his knights
for a fight.</p><p>
Merlin went to speak to the kings
and asked them what they were planning
to do.</p><p>
“Although whatever it is, you better
bow before King Arthur,” Merlin
added. “Because you will not win tonight,
even if you had ten times more
men than him.”</p><p>
“Why should we listen to a dreamreader?”
King Lot asked, preparing for
battle.</p><p>
Having heard that, Merlin vanished
away, and came back to Arthur.</p><p>
“Attack them fiercely,” he said, “Because
tonight you will win the battle.
But remember: only use your sword 
from the stone when you think the battle
is almost lost, and then you will
have your victory.”</p><p>
So Arthur came out with his knights,
and there was a great battle. Sir Baudwin,
Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias fought
bravely besides King Arthur and slain
great many enemies. King Arthur on
horseback did marvelous deeds of arms
with his sword, and many of the kings
had great joy seeing his deeds. Then
King Lot, King with the Hundred
Knights, and King Carados attacked
from behind, and went straight to King
Arthur. King Arthur turned to face
them, but when he came to fight King
Lot, his horse was slain underneath
him. Four of his knights got him up
and set him on another horse. Then
Arthur drew the sword he got from
the stone, and it was so bright in his
enemies’ eyes, that it gave light like
thirty torches. So he rode forward and
slew many people.</p><p>
The kings started to slowly retreat
their forces. Merlin advised Arthur 
what to do: not to try and slay them
all, but rather to send his knights to
press the kings and drive them on a
hill above the sea. So the kings fought
fiercely, almost surrounded by Arthur’s
forces and retreating step by step, until
at one moment they found that there
is no way to go. Arthur and his men
are on one side, a cliff above the sea
is on the other side.</p><p>
“This young man isn’t as young and
helpless as we thought,” said King
Uriens to King Lot. “It seems that we
should bow to him indeed, unless we’d
rather jump into the sea and die.”
The kings talked with each other
like that, and finally concluded that
King Arthur has proven himself worthy
indeed, so they pledged their loyalty
to him. Not all of the kings did
that gladly, but they decided to join
the others, at least for now.
</p><p>
After that there came a time for
great joy. King Arthur fell in love
with a daughter of one of his allies,
King of the land of Cameliard, and her
name was Guenever. Meanwhile, the
lords from his council said that Arthur
needs a wife. So he came to seek
Merlin’s advice.</p><p>
“My barons will let me have no rest,
but say that I need to take a wife,”
he said to Merlin. “But I don’t want
to wed anyone without asking for your
counsel first.”</p><p>
“It would be good,” said Merlin, “for
you to take a wife, because a man of
your blood and rank should not be
without a wife. Is there any woman
that you love more than others?”</p><p>
“Yes,” said King Arthur, “I love
Guenever, the daughter of king Leodegrance
of the land of Cameliard. She
is the fairest and the most beautiful
lady that I know living, or that I ever
could find.”</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “As for her beauty
and fairness, had you not loved her,
 I could find you a woman to your liking.
But if a man’s heart is set, he
will hate to change it.”</p><p>
“That is truth,” said Arthur.
So they arranged a marriage between
King Arthur and Guenever.</p><p>
“That is very good news,” said King
Leodegrance, “My daughter will have
the best husband possible. As for my
lands, I hear that King Arthur has so
many lands that he does not need more,
so I shall give him the Table Round,
which Uther Pendragon gave me long
ago. This table is round, and there are
places for a hundred knights and fifty.
A hundred good knights I have myself,
but the other fifty Arthur will
have to find himself.”
</p><p>
When they delivered the Table Round
to London and placed it in Arthur’s
castle, the chairs for that table had
knights’ names appeared on them. That
way, each knight had a set place, which
did not change so that nobody would
fight over a better place. More so, since
the table was round, every knight was
 at the same distance from the King,
who was sitting with his queen in the
middle.</p>
</div>

<h3><span>Chapter 4</span> in which Arthur fought with Sir
Pellinore, Merlin saved Arthur’s life,
and Arthur got his sword Excalibur</h3>
<div>

<p>
One time Arthur heard that not two
nights away from Carlion, a knight
blocked a road through the forest. Anybody
who wanted to pass had to joust
with that knight. So Arthur went to
put an end to it. Early in the morning
he set off from Carlion to that place.
He rode a soft pace until it was
day, and then he saw three bandits
chasing Merlin. The king rode unto
them3, and yelled “Flee, bandits!” They
were afraid to see a knight, so they
fled. “O Merlin,” said Arthur, “had I
not come to the rescue, they would 
have killed you, and your magic crafts
would not help you.”</p><p>
“No,” said Merlin, “I could save myself
if I wished to, and you are closer
to your end than I am to mine. You
are going to your death, and God is
not with you on that path.”</p><p>
They went on talking like that, until
they came to the fountain, and to
the rich pavilion near it. King Arthur
saw an armed knight sitting in a chair.</p><p>
“Sir knight,” said Arthur, “for what
cause are you sitting there, so that no
one can pass without jousting with you?
I demand that you stop doing that.”</p><p>
“This is a custom I’ve had for a long
time, and I live by it,” the knight replied.</p><p>
“And if someone doesn’t like my
custom, he should teach me a new one.”</p><p>
“I intend to do that,” said Arthur.
The knight mounted his horse and
took his shield and spear. They rode
unto each other and met so hard, that
both their spears were broken into small
pieces. Arthur took out his sword and
prepared to use it.</p><p>

“No,” said the knight, “Let us fight
on spears again.”</p><p>
“I would like it,” said Arthur, “but
I don’t have any spears.”</p><p>
“I do,” said the knight. So there
came a squire and brought them two
good spears. Arthur chose one of them,
and the knight took the other one. So
they spurred their horses, and again,
they met so hard that their spears
broke to the hilts. Once more Arthur
set hand on his sword. “No,” said the
knight, “You are the best jouster I’ve
met, so I want to joust with you once
more, for the love of the high order
of knighthood.” Again, a squire brought
two good spears, the knights rode unto
each other. This time, the knight stroke
Arthur so hard in his shield, so that
the man and the horse fell to the
ground. Arthur stood up and pulled
out his sword, and said, “Now I will
 attack you on foot with my sword, because
I have lost my horse.”</p><p>
“Very good,” said the knight, “I will
stay mounted and fight you.”</p><p>

Arthur was very angry to hear that.
He took his shield and started towards
the knight, with his sword drawn. When
the knight saw that Arthur indeed wanted
to fight him on foot, he decided that
there will be no honor in having such
an advantage. So he dismounted, took
his shield and sword, and went to fight
Arthur on foot. And there began a strong
battle with many great strokes, and soon
both their armours and shields were damaged
heavily, and the field was covered
in their blood. The knights took a short
rest, for they were tired, and then continued
the fight. Again they fought hard.</p><p>
At last, their swords met together in a
hard stroke. But the sword of the knight
broke Arthur’s sword in two pieces.</p><p>
“So,” said the knight, “You have
nothing to fight with, and your life is
in my hands now. If you want to live,
yield now.”</p><p>

“I will not yield,” said Arhur, “I
would rather die than to know such
shame.” And he leapt unto the knight,
took him by the middle, threw him
down, and tried to take off his helm.
But the knight turned over, brought
Arthur under him, took off his helm
and prepared to cut off Arthur’s head.
At this instant Merlin came to the
knight and said, “Knight, hold your
hand. If you slay that knight, you will
put this realm to the greatest damage
that it has ever seen, because this knight
is much more important than you think.”</p><p>
“Why, who is he?” said the knight.</p><p>
“This is king Arthur,” said Merlin.
Now the knight wanted to kill Arthur
even more, because he was afraid
of his revenge. But Merlin put a spell
on the knight so that he went asleep.</p><p>
“Alas!” said Arthur “What have you
done, Merlin? Have you slain this good
knight with your magic? There lived
no greater knight than he was, I would 
give away all my land for a year so
that he were alive.”</p><p>
“Don’t worry,” said Merlin, “I have
only put him to sleep, and he will
awake within three hours. I told you
what a knight he was, you would be
dead if not for me. There is no greater
knight than him, and he will do you
good service. His name is Sir Pellinore,
and he will have two sons that will do
many great deeds. Their names will be
Percivale of Wales and Lamerake of
Wales, and he will tell you the name
of your son from your sister, that will
be the destruction of all this realm.”</p><p>

After the fight Merlin took Arthur
to a hermit to rest and heal. For three
days Arthur and Merlin stayed at the
hermit’s shack, until Arthur was healed
and could travel again. As they set off,
Arthur said: “I have no sword”. “Do not
worry,” Merlin replied, “I know a good
sword nearby, let’s see if I can get it
for you”. So they rode through the forest,
until they came to a broad lake with 
fair water. In the middle of the lake
Arthur saw an arm dressed in white silk,
holding a beautiful sword in a scabbard.</p><p>
“This is the sword of which I spoke,”
said Merlin. “It is named Excalibur.”</p><p>
Then they saw a woman in white
garment. “Who is that?” Arthur asked.</p><p>
“That is the lady of the Lake,” said
Merlin, “when she comes to you, speak
fair to her, and she will give you that
sword.” The lady came to Arthur, and
saluted him.</p><p>
“Fair lady,” said Arthur, “What
sword is that the arm is holding above
the water? I would like to have it, for
I have lost my sword.”</p><p>
“Sir Arthur, king,” said the lady,
“that sword is mine. I can give it to
you, if you promise to do something
for me when I ask it of you later.”</p><p>
“I swear by my faith,” said Arthur,
“I will give you whatever you will ask.”</p><p>

“Well,” said the lady, “go into this
boat, and row to the sword, and take
it and the scabbard with you, and I
will ask my favor when the time comes.”
So Sir Arthur and Merlin dismounted,
tied their horses to two trees, and went
into the boat. When they came to the
sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur
took it by the handles, and took it
with him, and the arm and the hand
went under the water. An so they returned
to the land and rode on, and
then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.</p><p>
“What does this mean?” Arthur
asked.</p><p>
“It is the pavilion of the knight that
you fought with last, Sir Pellinore,”
Merlin replied, “but he is out, he is
not there. He fought with a knight of
yours, Egglame, and then Egglame ran
away, and Pellinore chased him even
to Carlion. He is returning now, and
we shall meet with him on the road.”</p><p>

“That is well said,” said Arthur, “now
I have a sword, and I will fight with
him again, and be avenged on him.”</p><p>
“Sir, do not do so,” said Merlin, “for
the knight is tired after fighting and
chasing. There will be no honor in defeating
him. I advise you to let him
pass, for he will do you good service
soon, and his sons will do you good service
after his days. You will soon see
that you will be so glad of him that you
will give him your sister to marry.”</p><p>
“When I see him, I will do as you
advise,” said Arthur.</p><p>
Then Sir Arthur examined his sword
and found it very much to his liking.</p><p>
“What do you like more,” Merlin
asked, “the sword or the scabbard?”</p><p>
“I like the sword much more,” said
Arthur.</p><p>
“You are unwise,” Merlin replied.</p><p>
“For the scabbard is worth ten of the
swords. While you have it on you, you
will never lose blood, and you will never
be wounded seriously. Keep the scabbard
 always with you.” So they rode to
Carlion, and on their way they met with
Sir Pellinore. But Merlin used his magic
so that Pellinore didn’t see Arthur,
and he passed by without any words.</p><p>
“I wonder why the knight did not
speak to me,” said Arthur.</p><p>
“Sir,” said Merlin, “He did not see
you, because had he seen you, you had
to fight him.”</p><p>
So they came to Carlion, where Arthur’s
knights were glad he returned.</p><p>
He told them about his adventures, and
they were happy because he would risk
his person by going alone. The knights
were merry to be under such a king,
who would put his life in adventure,
as other poor knights did.</p>
</div>

<h3><span>Chapter 5</span> in which Merlin found his end,
King Arthur lost his scabbard,
and a traitorous war was started</h3>
<div>

<p>
One time Merlin fell in love with
one fair but cunning lady. He wouldn’t
leave her alone, but would always be
with her. She didn’t answer him, but
asked Merlin to teach her his crafts.
So he was teaching her, until she learned
all she wanted, and then he wasn’t useful
to her. Merlin came to King Arthur,
and said: “Sir, soon I will be put
in the earth, despite all my crafts. You
will never see me again, so let me give
you my last counsel.”</p><p>
And he told the king many things
to come, and told him to always keep
well his sword and the scabbard, because
the scabbard would be stolen from 
him by a woman that he most trusted.
He also told King Arthur that he
will miss him.</p><p>
“You are wise,” said King Arthur,
“Please, use your craft to live more,
so that you won’t be put in the earth
anytime soon, because I would miss
you, too.”</p><p>
“I cannot do so,” said Merlin. And
he left.</p><p>
The lady that he was in love with
travelled a lot, and Merlin followed her
everywhere. She wanted to get rid of
him, so once, when Merlin showed her
a wonderful cave with a big stone that
could close the entrance. She asked
Merlin to go into the cave, and then
she used the crafts Merlin had taught
her to move the stone to cover the entrance.
She then enchanted the stone
so that nobody could move it, and then
she left, and Merlin was alone in a
closed cave.</p><p>

One time King Arthur decided to go
for an adventure. Early in the morning
 he set out alone to visit his sister,
Queen Morgana-le-Fay, who lived in a
small castle on a distant marsh. It was
a far and dangerous road. For many
days he rode through the forests and
across the meadows, until he came to
a forest so dark and deep that he had
to dismount and continue his way on
foot, leading his horse by the rein.</p><p>
Soon, he was so deep in the forest that
there was barely any light. Arthur continued
through the darkness, and after
some time he saw a small light at some
distance away from him. He turned
there and tried to reach the light, but
the light was getting farther and farther
away. Very soon Arthur had to tie
his horse to a tree and continue alone,
because the light got into the trees and
bushes, where a horse couldn’t go.</p><p>
Finally, Arthur came to a small clearing,
and the light was blinking right
in the middle of it. The king came
closer, and then he saw lots of fireflies
appear all around him, dancing in
the air. They lit so bright, and there
 were so many of them, that Arthur
couldn’t see the forest, or his horse,
or anything. Then they disappeared all
at once, and Arthur saw that he was
on a small island in the middle of the
marsh. There was nowhere to go, so
Arthur lay down and went to sleep.</p><p>

He saw a strange dream. He was in
a small room in a castle, lit up by candles
on the walls. Arthur wasn’t wearing
any armour, but his sword and his
scabbard were lying on a bed near one
of the walls. He tried looking out the
window, but it was too dark to see anything.
Then a lady in grey silk came
into the room, and as she opened the
door, all the candles went dark. Arthur
could barely see the lady, and he
couldn’t see her face at all. She took
him by the hand and led him to the
bed. They lay together, and then the
lady disappeared right from his arms.</p><p>
Arthur was very surprised, but there
was nothing he could do, and there
was no light. He wanted to go to sleep, 
but then he remembered what Merlin
had told him earlier. He took his sword
by the handle with both his hands and
went to sleep holding to it tightly.
He woke up in the same room, and
it was morning on the marsh. He was
still holding on to his sword, but now
he remembered the second part of Merlin’s
advice. The scabbard was gone,
and only his sword Excalibur was left.</p><p>
“Alas!” said Arthur, “For I have lost
my scabbard, despite what Merlin had
told me. It was a good scabbard, and
only my armour can protect me now.
I wonder where it had gone.”</p><p>
Arthur looked around and found a
table with food and wine, so he ate
and drank, and then he went to see if
there was anybody else in the castle.
But it was empty, and it looked like
no one had lived there for a long time.
Arthur found his horse in the stables,
it was fed and cleaned.</p><p>

“That is very strange,” said Arthur,
“But I should be on my way now.” So
he saddled his horse, mounted, and 
went from the castle. When he looked
back, he thought that he had seen this
castle before. “This is indeed the castle
of my sister, Queen Morgana-le-Fay!”
he exclaimed. “That is very strange.”
He then realized that the lady dressed
in grey silk must have been his sister,
and that it was her who took his scabbard.
But the castle was empty when
he left it, and he couldn’t remember
how he or his horse got into the castle
from the opening where he first
fell asleep. So there was nothing to do
for Arthur other than to return to his
castle. Everything went like Merlin had
told him, his scabbard was taken by
the woman he trusted most.</p><p>
Some time later a great war has
started. A knight named Sir Mordred
claimed to be the son of King Arthur
and his sister, Queen Morgana-le-Fay,
and since Arthur didn’t have an heir,
Mordred wanted to take land from Arthur,
and become king after Arthur’s
death. Arthur disagreed, and Mordred
 was very angry about that. He told
Arthur to prepare for war, and left.
He then went to every baron that
was unhappy with King Arthur’s rule,
and asked them to join him. He promised
them great rewards and many lands
if they fought for him. The barons
that lived far from Arthur, and didn’t
spend much time in London, were particularly
angry. And some of the barons
that didn’t want Arthur to be king
long ago, joined Sir Mordred, too. Very
soon Sir Mordred had a large army,
and with it he went to battle with Arthur.
He went through Arthur’s lands,
and laid a siege to one of Arthur’s
castles near the field of Camlann.
And there is where their big battle
happened.</p>
</div>

<h3><span>Chapter 6</span> in which the war was resolved,
King Arthur fought with
Sir Mordred, and Sir Bedivere
did what he was asked for</h3>
<div>

<p>
So upon Trinity Sunday at night,
King Arthur saw a wonderful dream.
He sat in a chair that stood on a wheel,
and he was dressed in the richest golden
clothing that can be made. And under
his feet there was a deep well, and
in that well there was black water, and
all kinds of serpents, and worms, and
wild beasts, foul and horrible. And suddenly
the wheel below Arthur’s chair
moved, and Arthur fell from his chair
into the black water, among the serpents.
And every beast bit him, and
the king cried as he lay in his bed
sleeping, “Help!”</p><p>
So the knights and squires woke up
the king, and he was very surprised 
to see that that was a dream. Then
the king started slumbering again, not
sleeping, but not awaken either. He
saw one of his fallen knights, Sir Gawaine,
alive and with a number of fair
ladies with him. And when King Arthur
saw him, he said, “Welcome, my
sister’s son. I thought you were dead,
but I am glad to see that you are alive.
Who are these ladies with you?”</p><p>
“Sir,” said Sir Gawaine, “These ladies
are all the ladies I fought for
when I was alive. And because I battled
for them in righteous quarrel, God
has rewarded me, and I am amongst
those ladies all the time now. But now
God let me come here to warn you of
your death. If you fight with Sir Mordred
tomorrow, you will die, and many
men on both parties will be killed. And
for all the grace Jesus has for you,
He let me come here to tell you this
warning.”</p><p>

“Do not fight with Sir Mordred tomorrow,”
Sir Gawaine continued. “Instead,
try to make peace with him for 
at least a month. Within a month Sir
Launcelot will come with his noble
knights, and then you will join with
him and slay Sir Mordred.”</p><p>
Then Sir Gawaine and all the ladies
vanished. The king called his knights
and squires and told them what Sir
Gawaine had said to him. He then commanded
Sir Lucan and his brother Sir
Bedivere to take two bishops with them
and go ask Sir Mordred for peace for
a month, and to give him whatever he
wants. So they departed, and came to
the camp of Sir Mordred and his hundred
thousand men. After a long negotiation,
Sir Mordred agreed to a peace.</p><p>
Now King Arthur and Sir Mordred
needed to meet to sign the peace treaty.
They agreed to meet the next day
between the two armies, having only
fourteen men with each of them as
guards.</p><p>

The next day came. Before leaving
to sign the treaty, Arthur warned his
fourteen knights: “We go to make peace, 
but I do not trust Sir Mordred. If you
see any sword drawn, that means treason,
so you should battle and slay as
many enemies as you can.”</p><p>
Sir Mordred also warned his fourteen
knights: “I do not trust King Arthur,
because he will want to take revenge
on me. If you see any sword
drawn, there will be no peace, and we
will battle.”</p><p>
So the two parties met in the middle
of the field, and drank wine, and
negotiated, and agreed with each other.
But before they signed the treaty,
one of the knights felt that something
bit him on the foot. He looked down
and saw a snake that came out of a
bush. The knight drew his sword and
killed the snake. But when the others
saw a sword drawn, everybody yelled
“Treason! Treason!” and blew trumpets
and horns, and shouted.</p><p>
King Arthur took his horse, and
said “Alas! This unhappy day!” and rode
back to his army. And Sir Mordred did
the same. And never was there seen a
 more glorious and horrible battle in no
Christian land. There was rushing and
riding, striking and beating, and many
men were slain that day. Many times
did King Arthur ride through the field
of battle, striking his enemies to the
right and to the left and doing great
deeds of arms. And so did Sir Mordred.</p><p>

Many fair knights got deadly strokes
that day. The battle went on from the
early morning till almost night, and
by that time a hundred thousand laid
dead on the field. Arthur was very
mournful to see so many of his people
die.</p><p>
By the end of the battle Arhur was
left with only two knights, Sir Lucan
and his brother Sir Bedivere, and they
were both wounded. “Jesus, have mercy,”
said the king, “Where have all my
knights gone? Alas that I ever should
see this horrible day, I must be coming
to my end. I wish I could find
that traitor Sir Mordred, to take revenge
for all the evil that he has done.” 
At that time Arthur saw Sir Mordred
standing in the field.</p><p>
“Now, give me my spear,” said Arthur
to Sir Lucan, “I see the traitor,
and I want to slay him.”</p><p>
“My lord, remember what Sir Gawaine
told you last night,” said Sir
Lucan. “Please, do not fight Sir Mordred.
You have won the field, because
there are three of us, and Sir Mordred
is alone. God has granted you victory,
and kept you alive, what else do you
want? You will die if you fight him
tonight, and we will lose our good king
for nothing.”</p><p>
“Tide me death, betide me life,”
said King Arthur, “I see the traitor
alone in the field, and I must slay him.
Now, give me my spear.”</p><p>
“God help you,” said Sir Lucan, and
gave Arthur his spear.</p><p>

“Traitor, I come for you!”, Arthur
yelled, and charged to strike Sir Mordred
 with his spear. Sir Mordred heard
Sir Arthur, so he turned to him with
a sword in his hand. Arthur ran to
Mordred and hit him with his spear,
under the shield. The spear went through
Sir Mordred’s armour and throughout
his body, and Arthur kept pushing it,
so he came close to Sir Mordred. Sir
Mordred then stroke Sir Arthur with
his sword, and the sword pierced Arthur’s
helm and his skull.</p><p>
Both the king and the traitor fell
to the ground, Sir Mordred dead, and
Arthur gravely wounded. Sir Lucan and
Sir Bedivere helped Arthur stand up
and led him from the field. Then they
heard people cry loudly in the field,
because robbers came to kill the wounded
and rob the dead from their valuables.
“Now go back to the field,” said the
king to Sir Lucan, “And drive the bandits
away.”</p><p>
Sir Lucan departed.</p><p>

“Alas!” said King Arthur, “I am dying,
as Sir Gawaine has told me. I have
one last debt to pay, before I can die.
I need to return my sword Excalibur
to the Lady of the Lake. Sir Bedivere,
take it, go to the Lake, throw the
sword into the water, and then come
back.”</p><p>
“My lord, I will do that,” said Sir
Bedivere. He then took the sword and
went to the Lake. But then he looked
at the sword, and said to himself: “This
sword is very good, and its hilt has
many precious stones. If I throw it
into the water, all of it will go to
waste.”</p><p>
So he hid the sword in the grass
near the lake, and hurried back to Arthur.</p><p>
“I have done as you told me,” he
said. “I threw the sword into the Lake.”</p><p>
“What did you see when you threw
it?” Arthur asked.</p><p>
“I saw nothing, but waves.” Sir Bedivere
answered. “No,” said Arthur, “You didn’t do
as I asked. Now go there again, and
throw the sword into the water.”
So Sir Bedivere went to the Lake
again, and took the sword, but then
he thought: “It is a sin and shame to
throw away such a good sword.” So he
hid it in the grass again, and came
back to Arthur.</p><p>
“I have done as you told me,” he
said. “I threw it into the water.”</p><p>
“What did you see when you did
it?” Arthur asked.</p><p>
“Only waves and circles on the water.”
Sir Bedivere answered.</p><p>
“Alas!” said Arthur, “Now you have
betrayed me twice. Was I not good to
you? You are called an honourable
knight, but you value a precious sword
more than your king’s words? Now go
again, and go fast, because I feel cold
already. But if you betray me again,
I swear I will slay you myself.”</p><p>

So for the third time Sir Bedivere
went to the Lake. He took the sword
by the hilt with both his hands, and 
threw it far into the lake. Then a hand
appeared from the water, caught the
sword by the handle, and went back
down. Sir Bedivere went back to Arthur.</p><p>
“I have done what you told me,” he
said.</p><p>
“What did you see this time?” Arthur
asked.</p><p>
“I saw a hand catch the sword by
the handle and drag in under water.”
Sir Bedivere said.</p><p>
“Finally, you were loyal to me,” said
Arthur. “I am dying, so carry me to
the Lake now.”</p><p>
Then Sir Bedivere took the king on
his back, and went with him to the
Lake. When they came close, they saw
a barge near the bank, and on that
barge were many fair ladies in black
hoods, and among them all was a queen,
and all the ladies wept when they saw
King Arthur.</p><p>
“Now put me in the barge,” said
the king. Sir Bedivere did that, softly, and
the ladies took him, and set him down,
and in one of their laps King Arthur
laid his head. And the ladies rowed
from the land, and Sir Bedivere looked
at all those ladies going from him.
Then he cried: “Ah my lord Arthur,
what will happen to me, now that you
go from me and leave me here among
my enemies?”</p><p>
“It is all right,” said the king, “Do
whatever you like. I cannot help you
anymore, because I need to go to the
vale of Avalon to heal my grievous
wound. And if you never hear of me
again, pray for my soul.”</p><p>
But when he was saying that, the
queens and ladies wept, and it was pity
to hear. And soon Sir Bedivere lost the
sight of the barge, and he wept, and
went to the forest.</p><p>
That is all there is to know about
King Arthur, his glorious deeds, his 
battles, and his knights of Table Round.
And this is where our tale ends.</p>

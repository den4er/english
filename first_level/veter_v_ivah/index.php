<h2>"THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS" <span>Kenneth Grahame</span></h2>

<h3><span>CHAPTER I</span> The River Bank</h3>
<div>

<p>The Mole was working very hard all the morning,
 spring-cleaning his little home. First he dusted it,
then he washed it, and finally he whitewashed it.
Spring was in the air above and in the earth below and
around him, coming even into his dark little house. He suddenly
dropped his brush on the ﬂoor, and jumped out ofthe
house. Something up above was calling him, and he made
for the little tunnel which led to the sun and air. So he
scraped and scratched and scratched and scraped, working
busily with his little paws and saying to himself, ‘Up we go!
Up we go!’ till at last his nose came out into the sunlight, and
he was rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.</p>
<p>
‘This is fine!’ he said to himself. ‘This is better than
whitewashing!’ The sunshine was hot on his fur, soft breezes
caressed his head, and he heard the song of happy birds.
Iumping on all his four legs at once, in the joy of living
and the delight of spring, he ran across the meadow till he
reached the hedge far off.</p>
<p>
‘Hold up!’ said an elderly rabbit. ‘SiXpence for passing by
the private road!’ The impatient Mole ran along the hedge 
and joked to the other rabbits as they looked from their
holes.</p>
<p>
It all seemed too good to be true. He saw everywhere
birds building, ﬂowers growing, leaves coming out —
everything happy, and busy. And instead of thinking about
whitewashing he could only feel how merry he was. After
all, the best part ofa holiday is perhaps not so much to have
rest, as to see all the others busy working.</p>
<p>
Suddenly he stopped at a river. He never saw a river before
— this shiny, wavy stream, running and laughing, fresh
and free. The Mole loved it at once. He walked by the side of
the river; when tired at last, he sat down on the bank, while
the river still chattered on to him.</p>
<p>
As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, he
saw a dark hole in the bank opposite. He thought, ‘What a
nice living-place it is, far from noise and dust!’ As he looked,
something bright and small appeared there like a little star.
Then he decided it was an eye; and a small face began to
grow up round it.</p>
<p>
A brown little face.</p>
<p>
A serious round face.</p>
<p>
Small ears and thick silky hair.</p>
<p>
It was the Water Rat!</p>
<p>
Then the two animals stood and looked at each other.</p>
<p>
‘Hullo, Mole!’ said the Water Rat.</p>
<p>
‘Hullo, Rat!’ said the Mole.</p>
<p>
‘Would you like to come over?’ asked the Rat.</p>
<p>
‘Oh, it’s all very well to TALK,’ said the Mole, because he
was new to a river and riverside life.</p>
<p>
The Rat said nothing, but pulled at a rope and then
stepped into a little boat. It was blue outside and white in
side, and was just the size for two animals. The Mole loved
it at once.</p>
<p>
The Rat rowed smartly and fast. Then he held up his
paw as the Mole stepped down. And to his surprise the
Mole found himself in the stern of a real boat.</p>
<p>
‘This is a wonderful day!’ said he, as the Rat started to
row again. ‘Do you know, it’s my first time in a boat in all
my life.’</p>
<p>
‘What?’ cried the Rat, with his mouth open: ‘You never —
well Ican’t believe it!’</p>
<p>
‘Is it so nice as all that?’ asked the Mole shyly, as he looked
at the cushions, the oars, and all the fascinating things.</p>
<p>
‘Nice?’ said the Water Rat. ‘Believe me, my young friend,
there is NOTHING — absolutely nothing — better then
travelling about in boats.’ He went on dreamily: ‘Travelling — about — in — boat—’</p>
<p>
‘Look ahead, Rat!’ cried the Mole suddenly.</p>
<p>
It was too late. The boat struck the bank. The dreamer
lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his feet in the air.</p>
<p>
‘—about in boats — or WITH boats,’ the Rat went on
peacefully, and stood up with a pleasant laugh. ‘In or out of
them, it doesn’t matter. Nothing really matters, that’s the
charm of it. You’re always busy, and you never do anything
in particular. Let’s have a boat-trip together?’</p>
<p>
The Mole was happy. ‘WHAT a day I’m having!’ he said.
‘Let’s start at once!’</p>
<p>
‘]ust a minute, then!’ said the Rat. He climbed up into
his hole above, and after a short interval reappeared with
a big basket.</p>
<p>
‘Put that under your feet,’ he said to the Mole. Then he
took the oars again.</p>
<p>
‘What’s inside it?’ asked the Mole.</p>
<p>
‘There’s cold chicken inside it,’ replied the Rat; ‘cold
tongue, cold ham, cold beef, cucumbers, salad, French rolls,
sandwiches, lemonade, soda water—’</p>
<p>
‘O stop, stop,’ cried the Mole: ‘This is too much!’</p>
<p>
‘Do you really think so?’ asked the Rat seriously. ‘It’s
only what I always take on these little excursions!’</p>
<p>
The Mole didn’t hear a word. He was entering the new
life, fascinated with the sparkle, the scents and the sounds
and the sunlight. He put a paw in the water and dreamed.
The Water Rat didn’t disturb him.</p>
<p>
‘I like your clothes, friend,’ he said after half an hour or
so. ‘I’m going to get a black velvet suit myself someday.’</p>
<p>
‘I beg your pardon,’ said the Mole. ‘But all this is so new
to me. So — this — is — a — River!’</p>
<p>
‘THE River,’ corrected the Rat.</p>
<p>
‘And you really live by the river? What a happy life!’</p>
<p>
‘By it and with it and on it and in it,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s
brother and sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food
and drink, and (naturally) washing. It’s my world, and I
don’t want any other. In winter or summer, spring or autumn,
it’s always got its fun and its excitements. When in February the brown water runs by my best bedroom window; or
again when it all goes away and there is mud that smells
like plum-cake, and I can find fresh food to eat, and things
that people throw out of boats!’</p><p>

‘What is over THERE?’ asked the Mole, showing with a
paw towards woodland that was on one side of the river.
</p><p>
‘O, that’s just the Wild Wood,’ said the Rat. ‘We don’t go
there very much, we river-bankers.’
</p><p>
‘Aren’t they — aren’t they very NICE people in there?’
said the Mole nervously.
</p><p>
‘Well,’ answered the Rat, ‘let me see. The squirrels are
all right. AND the rabbits — some of them. Weasels — and
stoats — and foxes — and so on. They’re all right in a way —
but well, you can’t really trust them, and that’s the fact.’
</p><p>
‘And what’s behind the Wild Wood?’ the Mole asked.
</p><p>
‘Behind the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,’ said the
Rat. ‘And that’s something that doesn’t matter. I never was
there, and I’m never going. Here’s our backwater at last,
where we’re going to lunch.’
</p><p>
They now passed into what looked like a little lake. It
was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both
paws and say, ‘O my! O my! O my!’
</p><p>
The Rat brought the boat to the bank, helped the Mole to
the shore, and took out the lunch-basket. The Mole wanted
to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat happily agreed, and
rested on the grass, while his excited friend shook out the
table-cloth and took out all the mysterious packets one by
one. When all was ready, the Mole was very glad, because
he was very hungry. ‘What are you looking at?’ said the Rat,
when the Mole’s eyes could leave the table-cloth a little.
</p><p>
‘I am looking,’ said the Mole, ‘at bubbles travelling along
the water. That is funny.’
</p><p>
‘Bubbles? Oho!’ said the Rat.
</p><p>
A broad shiny face showed itself above the bank, and the
Otter rose out and shook the water from his coat.
</p><p>
‘Why didn’t you invite me, Ratty?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘We didn’t plan the trip, it just happened,’ explained the
Rat. ‘By the way — my friend Mr. Mole.’
</p><p>
‘Glad,’ said the Otter, and the two animals became friends.
</p><p>
‘Such a crowd everywhere!’ continued the Otter. ‘All the
world is out on the river today. I came up this backwater to
get a moment’s peace.’
</p><p>
‘Well, tell us, WHO’S out on the river?’ said the Rat.
</p><p>
‘Toad’s out,’ replied the Otter. ‘In his new boat!’
</p><p>
The two animals looked at each other and laughed.
</p><p>
‘Once, it was nothing but sailing,’ said the Rat, ‘Then
he grew tired of that. Last year it was house-boating, and
we all stayed with him in his house-boat. He was going to
spend all his life in a house-boat. It’s all the same, whatever
he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something
new.’
</p><p>
‘Such a good fellow, ’ remarked the Otter. ‘But no stability!’
</p><p>
From where they sat they saw a boat, the rower —
a short, fat figure — rowing badly and rolling much, but
working hard. The Rat stood up and called him, but Toad —
for it was he — shook his head and continued his work.
</p><p>
‘He’ll be out of the boat in a minute, it’s rolling too much,’
said the Rat, sitting down again.
</p><p>
‘Of course he will,’ smiled the Otter.
</p><p>
‘Well, well,’ said the Rat, ‘I think it’s time to go. Who will
pack the lunch-basket?’
</p><p>
‘O, please let me,’ said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat
let him.
</p><p>
Packing the basket was not quite such pleasant work as
unpacking the basket. It never is. The afternoon sun was
getting low as the Rat rowed home, saying poetry-things
to himself, and not paying much attention to Mole. But the
Mole was very full of lunch, and pride, and already quite at 
home in a boat (so he thought), and then he said, ‘Ratty!
Please, I want to row, now!’
</p><p>
The Rat shook his head with a smile. ‘Not yet, my young
friend,’ he said, ‘you need some lessons. It’s not as easy as
it looks.’
</p><p>
The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But then he
jumped up and took the oars, so suddenly, that the Rat fell
backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for the second
time, while the happy Mole took his place.
</p><p>
‘Stop it, you SILLY!’ cried the Rat, from the bottom ofthe
boat. ‘You can’t do it! You’ll turn us over!’
</p><p>
The Mole made a great dig at the water. He missed, his
legs flew up above his head, and he found himself lying
on the top of the Rat. He caught the side of the boat, and
the next moment the boat went over, and he was in the
river.
</p><p>
O my, how cold the water was, and O, how VERY wet!
How it sang in his ears as he went down, down, down! Then
a strong paw caught him by the back of his neck. It was the
Rat, and he was laughing.
</p><p>
The Rat took the helpless animal to shore, and set him
down on the bank.
</p><p>
Then the Rat said, ‘Now, my fellow! Run up and down
the path till you’re warm and dry again, and I dive for the
basket’
</p><p>
So the Mole, wet and ashamed, ran about till he was
dry, while the Rat caught the boat and got to land with the
basket.
</p><p>
When all was ready, the Mole took his seat in the stern of
the boat; he said in a low voice, ‘Ratty, my dear friend! I am
very sorry for my foolish conduct. Will you forgive me?’
</p><p>
‘That’s all right!’ answered the Rat. ‘What’s a little wet to
a Water Rat? I’m more in the water than out of it most days.
Don’t think any more about it; and, look here! You can come
and stay with me for a little time. And I’ll teach you to row,
and to swim.’
</p><p>
The Mole was happy again.
</p><p>
When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the
room and got the Mole a dressing-gown and slippers, and
told him river stories till supper-time. Supper was a cheerful 
meal; but very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole
went to the best bedroom.
</p><p>
This day was only the first of many similar ones for the
Mole, each of them longer and full of interest. He learnt to
swim and to row, and came into the joy of running water.
</p><p>

<h3><span>CHAPTER II</span> The Open Road</h3>
<div>


<p>
‘Ratty,’ said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer 
morning, ‘will you do something for me?’
The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song.
</p><p>
‘What I wanted to ask you,’ said the Mole, ‘won’t you take
me to call on Mr. Toad? I heard so much about him, and I
really want to meet him.’
</p><p>
‘Why, certainly,’ said the Rat, jumping to his feet. ‘Get the
boat out, and we’ll go there at once. It’s never the wrong 
time to call on Toad. He’s always glad to see you, always
sorry when you go!’
</p><p>
‘He must be a very nice animal,’ said the Mole, as he got
into the boat and took the oars, while the Rat sat comfortably in the stern.
</p><p>
‘He is indeed the best ofanimals,’ replied Rat. ‘So simple,
so kind. Perhaps he’s not very clever — but he has got some
great qualities.’
</p><p>
They came to a beautiful old house, with nice green
lawns.
</p><p>
‘There’s Toad Hall,’ said the Rat; ‘and that small river on
the left leads to his boat-house, where we’ll leave the boat.
That’s the banqueting-hall you’re looking at now — very
old, that is. Toad is rich, and this is really one of the nicest
houses in these parts.’
</p><p>
In the large boat-house they saw many beautiful boats,
but none in the water.
</p><p>
The Rat looked around him. ‘I understand,’ said he. ‘He’s
tired of boating. Iwonder what new hobby he has now?
Come along and we will hear all about it.’
</p><p>
They found the Toad, who was resting in a garden-chair,
with a large map on his knees.
</p><p>
‘Hooray!’ he cried, jumping up when he saw them, ‘this
is wonderful!’ He shook the paws of both of them warmly. ‘How KIND of you!’ he went on, dancing round them. ‘I
was just going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty.
Iwant you badly — both of you. Now what will you take?
Come inside and have something!’
</p><p>
‘Let’s sit a little, Toady!’ said the Rat, while the Mole
spoke about Toad’s ‘wonderful residence.’
</p><p>
‘Finest house on the whole river,’ replied Toad. ‘Now,
look here. You are the very animals I wanted. You must help
me. It’s most important!’
</p><p>
‘It’s about your rowing, I think,’ said the Rat.
</p><p>
‘O, boating!’ said the Toad. ‘Silly hobby. Igave that up
LONG ago. No, I found the real thing, the only interest for
a life time. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your nice friend
also, and you will see!’
</p><p>
He led them to the yard, and there they saw a cart, shining, yellow with green, and red wheels.
</p><p>
‘There you are!’ said the Toad. ‘There’s real life for you, in
that little cart. The open road, camps, villages, towns, cities!
Here today, up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, joy! The whole world before you! And this
is the finest cart of its sort! Come inside and look!’
</p><p>
The Mole came into the cart with great interest. The Rat
stayed where he was.
</p><p>
It was indeed very comfortable. Little sleeping beds —
a little table — a cooking-stove, bookshelves, and pots, and
kettles of every size.
</p><p>
‘All ready!’ said the Toad triumphantly. ‘You see — biscuits, sardines — everything you can want. Soda-water
here — letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards and dominoes —
you’ll find,’ he continued, as they came out again, ‘you’ll find
everything, when we start this afternoon.’
</p><p>
‘Excuse me,’ said the Rat slowly, ‘but did I hear you say
something about “WE,” and “START,” and “THIS AFTER-
NOON?”
</p><p>
‘Now, you dear good old Ratty,’ said Toad, ‘don’t talk in
that stern way, because you know you MUST come. I can’t
go without you, so please don’t argue — it’s the one thing 
I can’t stand. You don’t want to stay on the old river all your
life, and live in a hole, and BOAT? Iwant to show you the
world! I’m going to make an ANIMAL ofyou, my boy!’
</p><p>
‘I’m not coming,’ said the Rat. ‘AndI AM going to live
on my old river, AND stay in a hole, AND boat. And what’s
more, Mole’s going to do as I do, aren’t you, Mole?’
</p><p>
‘Of course I am,’ said the Mole. ‘I’ll always be with you,
Rat, and what you say is true. All the same, it may be — well,
fun, you know!’ Poor Mole! The Adventure was such a new
thing to him, and he fell in love with the canary-colored cart
and all its little things.
</p><p>
The Rat saw what was going in his head. He was fond of
the Mole, and wanted to do almost anything for him. Toad
was watching them.
</p><p>
‘Come in, and have some lunch,’ he said, diplomatically,
‘let’s not decide anything in a hurry.’
</p><p>
During lunch the Toad painted the prospects of the trip
and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such bright
colours that the Mole couldn’t sit in his chair. The Rat could
not disappoint his two friends, who were already planning
for weeks ahead.
</p><p>
When they were ready, the Toad let his companions
catch the old grey horse. They set off, all talking at once.
It was a golden afternoon. The birds called to them; and
rabbits, sitting at their front doors, held up their paws, and
said, ‘O my! O my! O my!’
</p><p>
Late in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home,
they stopped and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass
by the side of the cart. Toad talked about all he was going
to do in the future, while stars grew larger all around them,
and a yellow moon came to keep them company and listen 
to their talk. At last they went to their little beds in the cart;
and Toad sleepily said, ‘Well, good night, my friends! This is
the real life for a gentleman! Talk about your old river!’
</p><p>
‘I DON’T talk about my river,’ replied the Rat. ‘But I
THINK about it, all the time!’
</p><p>
The Mole took the Rat’s paw in the darkness. ‘I’ll do what
you like, Ratty,’ he said quietly. ‘Will we run away tomorrow
morning, quite early — VERY early — and go back to our
dear old hole on the river?’
</p><p>
‘No, no, ‘answered the Rat. ‘Thanks, but I must be with
Toad till this trip ends. It won’t be safe for him to stay alone.
His hobbies never take long. Good night!’
</p><p>
The end was indeed nearer than even the Rat thought.
</p><p>
After so much open air and excitement the Toad slept
late, and the two friends couldn’t get him out of bed next
morning. So the Mole and Rat took care of the horse, and
made a fire, and cleaned last night’s cups and plates, and
made breakfast. The hard work ended by the time Toad got
up, fresh and happy, saying what a pleasant easy life it was
now, after the difficulties of housekeeping at home.
</p><p>
They had a pleasant trip that day over grassy meadows,
and camped as before, only this time the two friends took
care that Toad did his part of work. Their way lay, as before,
across country, and in the afternoon they came out on the
big road, and there catastrophe happened.
</p><p>
They were walking along the road, the Mole by the horse’s
head, talking to him, the Toad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together, when far behind them they
heard a sound, like a faraway bee. Looking back, they saw
a small cloud of dust, coming after them at great speed.
They continued talking, when in a second the peaceful scene 
changed, and with wind and sound that made them jump to
the nearest ditch, It was on them! The ‘Poop-poop’ rang in
their ears. For a moment they saw a rich interior, and the
wonderful motor-car, great, beautiful, with its driver holding
the wheel, threw a cloud of dust, and then disappeared in the
far distance.
</p><p>
The old grey horse in a new situation let out his natural
emotions. He was jumping and tearing and he drove the
cart backwards to the deep ditch at the side of the road.
There was a loud crash — and the canary-colored cart, their
pride and their joy, fell on its side in the ditch.
</p><p>
The Rat danced up and down in the road. ‘You bandits!’
he shouted, ‘I’ll report you! I’ll take you to the police!’ He
was saying all the things he said to masters of boats when
they drove too near his house.
</p><p>
Toad sat down in the middle of the dusty road, and was
looking in the direction of the disappearing motor-car. His
face was peaceful, and at intervals he repeated, ‘Poop-poop!’
</p><p>
The Mole was busy with the horse. Then he went to look
at the cart, on its side in the ditch. The damage was great.
</p><p>
The Rat came to help him, but they couldn’t right the
cart. ‘Hi! Toad!’ they called. ‘Come and help!’
</p><p>
The Toad didn’t answer, so they went to see what the matter with him was. They found him in a sort of a trance, a happy
smile on his face. At intervals he was still saying, ‘Poop-poop!’
</p><p>
‘Are you coming to help us, Toad?’ the Rat asked sternly.
</p><p>
‘The poetry of moving!’ said Toad. ‘The REAL way to
travel! The ONLY way to travel! Here today — there tomorrow! Villages, towns and cities jumped — always somebody
else’s horizon! O poop-poop! O my! O my!’
</p><p>
‘O STOP it, Toad!’ shouted the Mole.
</p><p>
‘And to think I never KNEW!’ went on the Toad in a dreamy
monotone. ‘All those years, I never knew, never even DREAMT!
But NOW — but now that I know, I fully understand! O what
a ﬂowery road is before me! What dust-clouds will jump up
behind me as I hurry on my way! What carts I will throw into
the ditch! Horrible little carts — canary-coloured carts!’
</p><p>
‘What will we do with him?’ asked the Mole of the Water Rat.
</p><p>
‘Nothing at all,’ replied the Rat firmly ‘You see, I know him
long enough. He has got a new interest, and it always takes
him that way, in the beginning. He’ll continue like that for days
now, like an animal walking in a happy dream. Let’s go and see
what we can do about the cart.’
</p><p>
A careful inspection showed them that the cart could not
travel longer. The Rat led the horse. ‘Come on!’ he said to the
Mole. ‘It’s five or six miles to the nearest town, and we must
walk it. The sooner we make a start the better.’
</p><p>
‘But what about Toad?’ asked the Mole. ‘We can’t leave him
here, sitting in the middle of the road by himself! It’s not safe.’
</p><p>
‘O, BOTHER Toad,’ said the Rat; ‘I’m tired of him!’
</p><p>
They didn’t go very far on their way, when there was a pattering of feet behind them, and Toad caught them up and took
them by paws.
</p><p>
‘Now, look here, Toad!’ said the Rat sternly: ‘as soon as we
get to the town, you must go to the police-station, and see if
they know anything about that car, and report against it. And
then you must take care of the cart. It needs repairing. The
Mole and I will find comfortable rooms where we can stay till
the cart’s ready, and till you’re all right again after the shock.’
</p><p>
‘Police-station! Report!’ said Toad dreamily ‘Me REPORT
on that beautiful sight! Repair the CART! I had enough of carts.
I never want to see the cart, or to hear of it, again!’
‘Do you see what it is?’ the Rat said to the Mole, addressing
him across Toad’s head: ‘I give it up — when we get to the
town we’ll go to the railway station, and with luck we may get
on a train there that’ll get us back to river bank tonight. And I
will never go with this animal again!’
</p><p>
In the town they went to the station, and a slow train landed them at a station not very far from Toad Hall. They led the
sleep-walking Toad to his door and put him inside it. Then
they got out their boat from the boat-house, rowed down the
river home, and at a very late hour sat down to supper in their
own riverside home, to the Rat’s great joy.
</p><p>
The following evening the Mole was sitting on the bank
fishing, when the Rat came running along to find him. ‘Heard
the news?’ he said. ‘Everybody is talking about it, all along the
river bank. Toad went up to Town by an early train this morning. And he ordered a large and very expensive car.’
</p>

<h3><span>CHAPTER III</span> The Wild Wood</h3>
<div>


<p>
The Mole wanted to make friends with the Badger. He 
seemed to be an important person. The Water Rat
said: ‘It’s all right. Badger will come some day, and
then I’ll introduce you.’
</p><p>
‘Couldn’t you invite him for dinner?’ said the Mole.
‘He won’t come,’ replied the Rat. ‘Badger hates Society,
and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.’
‘Couldn’t we go and call on HIM, then?’ asked the Mole.
</p><p>
‘O, he won’t like that at ALL,’ said the Rat. ‘He’s so
very shy, I never call on him at his own home. Besides,
we can’t, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild
Wood.’
</p><p>
‘You said, “The Wild Wood is all right.”’
</p><p>
‘O, I know, so it is,’ replied the Rat. ‘But we won’t go there
just now.’
</p><p>
But the Badger never came along, and every day brought
its joys. Summer was over, and cold and frost kept them indoors, and the Mole often thought about the grey Badger,
who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle
of the Wild Wood.
</p><p>
In the winter time the Rat slept a lot. During his short
day he sometimes wrote poetry or did other small jobs
about the house; and, of course, there were always animals
coming in for a chat, and there was much story-telling.
</p><p>
On those short winter days when the animals sat round
the fire, the Mole had a lot of free time. So one afternoon he
decided to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood,
and perhaps meet Mr. Badger.
</p><p>
It was a cold afternoon with a grey sky, when he left the
warm house. The country lay leaﬂess around him, and he
could see so far on that winter day when Nature was deep
in her sleeping. With great enthusiasm he went towards
the Wild Wood, which lay before him, like a black island in
some southern sea.
</p><p>
There was nothing to be afraid of, all was fun. It led him
on, and he went to where the light was less, and trees came
nearer and nearer, and holes looked ugly.
</p><p>
Everything was very quiet now. The darkness grew.
</p><p>
Then the faces began.
</p><p>
He first thought he saw a face; a little evil face, looking 
out at him from a hole. When he turned, it disappeared.
</p><p>
Then suddenly every hole, far and near — and there
were hundreds of them — seemed to have its face, coming
and going, looking at him, all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.
</p><p>
He got away from the holes in the banks and went into
the wood.
</p><p>
Then the whistling began.
</p><p>
It was behind him, when first he heard it. Then it sounded far ahead ofhim. He stopped and wanted to go back. They
were up and ready, somebody! And he — he was alone, and
far from any help; and the night was coming.
</p><p>
Then he heard the pattering of little feet. Was it in front
or behind? It seemed coming nearer to him. As he stood
listening, a rabbit came running hard towards him through
the trees. ‘Get out of this, you fool, get out!’ the Mole heard
him say as he disappeared in a hole.
</p><p>
The whole wood seemed running now. In panic, the Mole
began to run too, he didn’t know where. He fell over things
and into things, he ran under things and round things. At last
he hid in the deep dark hole of an old tree. He was too tired
to run further, and could only hide into the dry leaves. And as
he lay there and listened to the whistlings and the patterings
outside, he knew it at last — the Terror of the Wild Wood!
</p><p>
At that time the Rat, warm and comfortable, was sleeping by his fireside. Then he woke, and looked round for the
Mole.
</p><p>
But the Mole was not there.
</p><p>
He listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.
</p><p>
Then he called, ‘Moly!’ several times, and, having no answer, got up and went out into the hall.
</p><p>
There were neither Mole’s cap, nor his galoshes.
</p><p>
The Rat left the house, and examined the muddy ground
outside for the Mole’s tracks. There they were, leading direct to the Wild Wood.
</p><p>
The Rat stood in deep thought for a minute or two. Then
he entered the house, took pistols and a stick and went to
the Wild Wood.
</p><p>
It was already getting dark when he came into the wood,
looking for his friend. Here and there evil little faces looked
out of holes, but disappeared at sight of the brave animal,
his pistols, and the great ugly stick; and the whistling and
pattering stopped. He made his way through the wood, all
the time calling out, ‘Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It’s
me — it’s old Rat!’
</p><p>
At last to his joy he heard a little answering cry. He came
to the foot of an old tree, with a hole in it, and from out of
the hole came a voice, saying ‘Ratty! Is that really you?’
</p><p>
The Rat found the Mole, tired and trembling. ‘O Rat!’ he
said, ‘I was so afraid, you can’t think!’
</p><p>
‘O, I understand,’ said the Rat. ‘Coming here was the
wrong thing to do, Mole. I did my best to keep you from
it. We river-bankers very seldom come here. If we must
come, we come in twos, at least. Besides, there are a hundred things one must know, which we understand all about
and you don’t. I mean secret words, which have power and
effect, and plants you have with you, and poems you repeat.’
</p><p>
‘The brave Mr. Toad can come here by himself, can’t he?’
asked the Mole.
</p><p>
‘Old Toad?’ laughed the Rat. ‘He can’t show his face here
alone, not for a lot of gold.’
</p><p>
The Mole began to feel better and more himself again.
</p><p>
‘Now then,’ said the Rat, ‘we must make a start for home.’
</p><p>
‘Dear Ratty,’ said the poor Mole, ‘I’m so sorry, but I’m so
tired. You MUST let me rest here a little longer.’
</p><p>
‘O, all right,’ said the kind Rat, ‘have some rest. It’s nearly
dark now, and there may be moon later.’
</p><p>
So the Mole got into the dry leaves and fell asleep, while the
Rat covered himself up, too, for warmth, and lay with a pistol
in his paw.
</p><p>
When at last the Mole woke up, much rested, the Rat said,
‘Now then! I’ll just take a look outside and see if everything’s
quiet, and then we must go.’
</p><p>
He went to the entrance and put his head out. Then the
Mole heard him saying quietly to himself, ‘Hullo! hullo!
here — is — a — go!’
</p><p>
‘What is it, Ratty?’ asked the Mole.
</p><p>
‘SNOW,’ replied the Rat brieﬂy; ‘It’s snowing hard.’
</p><p>
The Mole came and, looking out, saw that the wood
changed. Holes, pools, and other black objects were disappearing fast, and a sparkling carpet covered everything.
</p><p>
‘Well, well,’ said the Rat, after some thinking. ‘We must
make a start. The worst of it is, I don’t know where we are.
And now this snow makes everything look so different.’
</p><p>
They went out bravely, and kept walking for an hour or
two. After several falls they were wet through; the snow was
so deep that they could hardly draw their little legs through it.
Then they stopped, tired, and sat down on a fallen tree to rest
and to think what to do. There seemed to be no end to this
wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst of
all, no way out.
</p><p>
‘We can’t sit here very long,’ said the Rat. ‘The cold is too
awful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for 
us to walk through.’ He looked about him. ‘There in front of
us,’ he went on, ‘the ground seems all hilly. We’ll try and find
some sort of a hole with a dry ﬂoor to it, out of the snow and
the wind, and there we’ll have a good rest before we try again.’
</p><p>
So once more they got on their feet, and went on, and
looked for some corner that was dry. Suddenly the Mole fell
forward on his face.
</p><p>
‘O my leg!’ he cried. ‘O my poor leg!’ and he sat up on the
snow and held his leg in both his front paws.
</p><p>
‘Poor old Mole!’ said the Rat kindly. ‘Let’s have a look at
the leg. Yes,’ he went on, ‘you cut your leg. Wait till I get at
my handkerchief, and I’ll bandage it for you.’
</p><p>
‘It was some stick, I believe’ said the Mole. ‘O, my! O, my!’
</p><p>
‘It doesn’t look like a stick,’ said the Rat. ‘Looks as if it
was something in metal. Funny!’ He examined the snow
around them.
</p><p>
‘Well, it doesn’t matter,’ said the Mole. ‘It’s painful just
the same.’
</p><p>
But the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his
handkerchief, left him and got busy scraping in the snow.
He scratched, all four legs working busily, while the Mole
waited, remarking at intervals, ‘O, COME on, Rat!’
</p><p>
Suddenly the Rat shouted ‘Hooray!’
</p><p>
‘What did you find, Ratty?’ asked the Mole. The Rat
showed it. The Mole had a good look.
</p><p>
‘Well,’ he said at last, slowly, ‘I SEE a door-scraper! Well,
what of it?’
</p><p>
‘But don’t you see what it MEANS, you — you silly animal?’ asked the Rat. ‘Here, stop talking and come and
scrape!’ And he worked again and made the snow ﬂy in all
directions around him.
</p><p>
The Mole scraped busily too. Some ten minutes’ hard
work, and the Rat found something and called the Mole to
come and help him. At last the result of their work stood in
front of them.
</p><p>
In the side ofa snow-bank was a little door, painted dark
green. An iron bell hung by the side, and below it they could
read MR. BADGER.
</p><p>
The Mole fell backwards on the snow from surprise
and joy. ‘Rat!’ he shouted, ‘you’re a wonder! A real wonder,
that’s what you are. I see it all now! From the moment that
I fell and cut my leg, and you looked at the cut, and at once
your wonderful mind said, ”Door-scraper!" And did you
stop there? No. Your intellect went on working!’
</p><p>
‘Are you going to sit on the snow all night and TALK?’ the
Rat stopped him, rather unkindly, ‘Get up at once and ring!’
</p><p>
While the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole
rang the bell.
</p>

<h3><span>CHAPTER IV</span> Mr. Badger</h3>
<div>


<p>
They waited for a very long time. At last they heard the 
sound of slow footsteps. The door opened a few inchesl, 
enough to show a long nose and sleepy eyes.
‘Now, the next time this happens,’ said a voice, ‘I will be
very angry. Who is it THIS time? Speak up!’
</p><p>
‘Oh, Badger,’ cried the Rat, ‘let us come in, please. It’s me,
</p><p>
Rat, and my friend Mole, and we lost our way in the snow.’
</p><p>
‘What, Ratty, my dear little man!’ said the Badger, in a
different voice. ‘Come in, both of you, at once. Lost in the
snow! And in the Wild Wood, too, and at this time of night!
But come in.’
</p><p>
The two animals heard the door shut behind them with
great joy.
</p><p>
The Badger wore a long dressing-gown and slippers. He
looked kindly on them and patted both their heads. ‘This
is not the sort of night for small animals to be out,’ he said.
‘But come along; come into the kitchen. There’s a fire there,
and supper and everything.’
</p><p>
He went on in front of them, down a long, dark corridor, into a central hall; out of which they could see other
long tunnel-like corridors. But there were doors in the hall.
One of these the Badger opened, and at once they were in
warmth of a large kitchen.
</p><p>
In the middle of the room stood a long table. At one end
of it, where an armchair stood, was the Badger’s supper.
Overhead hung hams, dried herbs, onions, and baskets of
eggs. It seemed a place where two or three friends could sit
and eat and talk in comfort.
</p><p>
The kindly Badger sat them down, and told them to take
off their wet coats and boots. Then he gave them dressing-gowns and slippers, and bathed the Mole’s leg with
warm water and put the sticking-plaster on the cut. In the
light and warmth, warm and dry at last, it seemed to the
animals, that the cold Wild Wood was miles and miles away.
</p><p>
The Badger laid the table, and when they saw at last the
supper, really it seemed only a question of what they attack 
first where all was so nice. Talk was with their mouths full.
The Badger did not mind that sort ofthing at all, he did not
see elbows on the table, or everybody speaking at once. As
he did not go into Society himself, he had got an idea that
these things didn’t really matter. (We know of course that
he was wrong, because they matter very much.) He sat in
his armchair at the head of the table, and listened as the
animals told their story; and he did not show any surprise
or shock, and he never said, ‘I told you so,’ or, ‘Iust what I
always said.’ The Mole began to feel very friendly towards
him.
</p><p>
After supper they gathered round the fire, and the
Badger asked, ‘Now then! tell me the news from your part
of the world. How’s old Toad going on?’
</p><p>
‘Oh, from bad to worse,’ said the Rat. ‘You see, he wants
to drive himself, and he can’t. Nobody can teach him anything.
</p><p>
‘How many did he have?’ asked the Badger.
</p><p>
‘Cars?’ asked the Rat. ‘Oh, this is the seventh.’
</p><p>
‘Three times in hospital,’ added the Mole; ‘and it’s simply awful to think of the money he paid for fines.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, and that’s part of the trouble,’ said the Rat. ‘Toad’s
rich, we all know; but he’s not a millionaire. And he’s a bad
driver, and doesn’t know order. He will lose his life or his
money — sooner or later. Badger! we’re his friends — We
must do something!’
</p><p>
The Badger thought hard. ‘Now look here!’ he said at
last, ‘of course you know I can’t do anything NOW?’
</p><p>
His two friends agreed. No animal can do anything heroic, or even active during winter. All are sleepy — some
asleep. All are resting.
</p><p>
‘Very well then!’ continued the Badger. ‘BUT, when the
nights are shorter — YOU know!’
</p><p>
Both animals agreed. THEY knew!
</p><p>
‘Well, THEN,’ went on the Badger, ‘we — I mean, you and
me and our friend the Mole here — we’ll take Toad seriously in hand. We’ll bring him back to reason. We’ll MAKE him
be a clever Toad. We’ll — you’re sleeping, Rat!’
</p><p>
‘Not me!’ said the Rat, waking up.
</p><p>
‘You are, and not for the first time since supper,’ said the
Mole, laughing. He himself was feeling wakeful and even lively, he didn’t know why. The reason was, of course, that he
was naturally an underground animal, and the situation of
Badger’s house made him feel at home; while the Rat, who
slept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened
on the river, naturally felt the atmosphere oppressive.
</p><p>
‘Well, it’s time to go to bed,’ said the Badger. ‘Come, and
I’ll show you to your room. And take your time tomorrow
morning — breakfast at any hour you like!’
</p><p>
He led the two animals to a long room that seemed only
half bedroom. The Badger’s winter foods took up half the
room — piles of apples, turnips, and potatoes, baskets full
of nuts, and jars of honey; but the two little white beds on
the floor looked soft and nice, and the Mole and the Water
Rat lay down in great joy.
</p><p>
The two tired animals came down to breakfast very late
next morning, and found a bright fire in the kitchen, and
two young hedgehogs sitting at the table, eating porridge.
The hedgehogs left their spoons and stood up respectfully.
</p><p>
‘Sit down, sit down,’ said the Rat, ‘and go on with your
porridge. Where did you youngsters come from? Lost your
way in the snow?’
</p><p>
‘Yes, sir,’ said the elder of the two hedgehogs respectfully. ‘Me and little Billy here, we were trying to find our way to
school, and of course we lost ourselves, sir, and Billy, he got
frightened and cried. And at last we saw Mr. Badger’s back
door, and came in, sir, for Mr. Badger, he’s a kind gentleman,
as everyone knows—’
</p><p>
‘I understand,’ said the Rat, cutting himself some bacon,
while the Mole put some eggs into a plate. ‘And what’s the
weather like outside?’
</p><p>
‘O, terribly bad, sir, the snow is terribly deep,’ said the
hedgehog. ‘No getting out today.’
</p><p>
‘Where’s Mr. Badger?’ asked the Mole, as he warmed the
coffee-pot before the fire.
</p><p>
‘The master went to his room, sir,’ answered the hedgehog, ‘and he said, “I’m was very busy this morning.”’
</p><p>
The animals well knew that Badger, after a big breakfast,
went to his room and sat himself in an armchair with his
legs up on another and a red cotton handkerchief over his
face, and was ‘busy’ in the usual way at this time of the year.
</p><p>
The front-door bell rang loudly, and the Rat, who was
very busy with his toast, sent Billy, the smaller hedgehog, to
see who it was. There was a sound of stamping in the hall,
and Billy returned in front of the Otter, who threw himself
on the Rat with joy.
</p><p>
‘Get off!’ cried the Rat, with his mouth full.
</p><p>
‘Thought I could find you here all right,’ said the Otter.
‘They were all in a great alarm along River Bank when I arrived this morning. Rat wasn’t home all night — nor Mole
either — something dreadful happened, they thought; and
the snow covered up all your tracks, of course. But I know
that when people are in trouble they mostly go to Badger, 
or else Badger gets to know of it somehow. So I came here,
through the Wild Wood and the snow! My! it was fine, com-
ing through the snow as the red sun was rising and showing
against the black tree-trunks! About halfway across I came
on a rabbit, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He was a
pretty scared animal. He told me about the Mole’s coming
to the Wild Wood.’
</p><p>
‘Weren’t you at all — er — nervous?’ asked the Mole,
some of yesterday’s terror coming back to him at the words
of the Wild Wood.
</p><p>
‘Nervous?’ cried The Otter showing strong white teeth
as he laughed. ‘I can make them nervous myself. Here, Mole,
fry me some slices of ham, like the good little boy you are.
I’m very hungry, and I’ve got something to say to Ratty here.’
</p><p>
So the Mole cut some slices ofham, asked the hedgehogs
to fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter
and the Rat, their heads together, talked about the river.
</p><p>
Then the Badger came, rubbing his eyes, and greeted them
all. ‘It must be lunch time,’ he said to the Otter. ‘Better stop and
have it with us. You must be hungry, this cold morning.’
</p><p>
‘Here, you two youngsters, be off home to your mother,’
said the Badger kindly. ‘I’ll send someone with you to show
you the way.’
</p><p>
He gave them siXpence apiece and a pat on the head, and
they went off with much respect.
</p><p>
They all sat down to lunch together. The Mole’s place
was near Mr. Badger, and, as the other two were still deep
in talk, he told Badger how comfortable and home-like it
all felt to him. ‘When you are underground,’ he said, ‘you
know exactly where you are. Nothing can happen to you.
You’re your own master, and you don’t need to ask anybody.
</p><p>
Things go on all the same overhead, and you let them, and
don’t bother about them. When you want to, you go up, and
there the things are, waiting for you.’
</p><p>
The Badger simply smiled at him. ‘That’s what I always
say,’ he answered. ‘There’s no security, or peace, except
underground. If you feel your house is a bit too big, you stop
up a hole or two, and there you are again! No builders, no
salesmen, and, above all, no WEATHER. Look at Rat, now.
A couple of feet of ﬂood water, and he needs to leave his house;
uncomfortable, badly situated, and horribly expensive. Take
Toad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best house
in these parts, AS a house. But if a fire breaks out — where’s
Toad? If walls sink or crack, or windows break — where’s
Toad? No, up and out of doors is good enough to walk; but
underground to come back to at last — that’s my idea of
HOME.’
</p><p>
The Mole agreed; and the Badger got very friendly with
him. ‘When lunch is over,’ he said, ‘I’ll take you all round
this little place. You understand what domestic architecture
must be, you do.’
</p><p>
After lunch the Mole followed the Badger. Crossing the
hall, they went down one of the tunnels, and saw rooms
on either side, both large and small, some like cupboards,
others nearly as big as Toad’s dining-hall. ‘How, Badger,’ the
Mole said at last, ‘did you ever find time and strength to do
all this? It’s wonderful!’
</p><p>
‘I did none of it — only cleaned out the corridors and
rooms,’ said the Badger simply, ‘I see you don’t understand, 
and I must explain it to you. Well, very long ago, on the place
where the Wild Wood is now, before it, there was a city —
a city of people, you know. Here, where we are standing,
they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on
their own business. They were a powerful people, and rich,
and great builders.’
</p><p>
‘But what happened to them all?’ asked the Mole.
</p><p>
‘Who can tell?’ said the Badger. ‘People come — they stay
for a while, they build — and they go. It is their way But we
stay There were badgers here, long before that city ever came
to be. And now there are badgers here again. We may move
out for a time, but we wait, and are patient, and we come back.
And so it will ever be.’
</p><p>
‘Well, and when they went at last, those people?’ said the
Mole.
</p><p>
‘When they went,’ continued the Badger, ‘the strong
winds and rains went on year after year. Perhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a little — who knows?
It was all down, down, down, — ruin and disappearance.
Then it was all up, up, up, as seeds grew to trees, and trees
to forest, and insects came in to help. Leaf-mounts rose,
streams brought sand, and in time our home was ready for
us again, and we moved in. Up above us, the same thing
happened. Animals came, liked the look of the place, took
up their homes. There are a lot ofanimals in the Wild Wood.
We must all live and let live.’
</p><p>
When they got back to the kitchen again, they found the
Rat walking up and down, very nervous. The underground
atmosphere was oppressing him and getting on his nerves and
he worried about the river. So he had his overcoat on, and his
pistols into his belt again. ‘Come along, Mole,’ he said, as soon 
as he saw them. ‘We must get off while it’s daylight. I don’t
want to spend another night in the Wild Wood again.’
</p><p>
‘It’ll be all right, my fine fellow,’ said the Otter. ‘I’m coming
along with you, and I know every path.’
</p><p>
The Badger said them good-bye and soon they were out
of the Wild Wood. Rocks and tree-roots were behind them;
in front, a great space of quiet fields, hedges black on the
snow, and, far ahead, familiar old river, while the wintry sun
hung red and low on the horizon. Pausing there a moment
and looking back, they saw the Wild Wood, large, evil in
white surroundings; they turned and went quickly home,
for firelight, for the river that they knew, that never made
them afraid.
</p>
</div> 

 
<h3><span>CHAPTER V</span> Sweet Home</h3>
<div>




<p>
The two animals were walking with much chatter and 
laughter. They were returning across the country 
after a long day with Otter, hunting and exploring
where streams to their own River had their first small
beginnings; and the short winter day was closing on them,
and they had still some distance to go. ‘It seems we are
coming to a Village,’ said the Mole, as the path became a
road. The animals did not like villages. ‘Oh, never mind!’
said the Rat. ‘At this season of the year they’re all indoors
by this time, sitting round the fire; men, women, and
children, dogs and cats and all. We will slip through all right, 
without any trouble, and we can have a look at them through
their windows if you like, and see what they’re doing.’
</p><p>
The quick nightfall of mid-December surrounded the little village as they came on soft feet over a first thin fall of
snow. They saw only squares of orange-red on either side of
the street, where the firelight or lamplight of each cottage
burnt. Most of the low windows were without curtains, and
the lookers-in from outside saw people sitting round the
tea-table, doing handiwork, or talking with laughter and
gesture. Moving from one theatre to another, the two spectators, so far from home themselves, felt sad.
</p><p>
Then a cold wind took them in the back of the neck,
woke them as from a dream, and they knew their toes were
cold and their legs tired, and their own home far away.
</p><p>
Behind the village, where the cottages disappeared, on
either side of the road they could smell through the darkness
the friendly fields again; and they got ready for the last long
walk, the walk home, that we know must end, some time, in
the sudden firelight, and the sight of well-known things greeting us as long-absent travellers from far over-sea. They went
along, each of them thinking his own thoughts. The Mole was
following the Rat, as it was dark, and it was a strange country
for him. As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, his
eyes on the straight grey road in front of him; so he did not
notice poor Mole when suddenly the smell reached him, and
took him like an electric shock.
</p><p>
Home! That was what the smell meant! Why, it seemed
to be quite near at that moment, his old home! Now, for
the first time since his escape on that bright morning, he
remembered it!
</p><p>
‘Ratty!’ he called, full ofjoy, ‘wait! Come back!’
</p><p>
‘Oh, COME along, Mole!’ replied the Rat, still walking.
</p><p>
‘PLEASE stop, Ratty!’ asked the poor Mole. ‘You don’t
understand! It’s my home, my old home! It’s really quite
near. I MUST go to it, I must, I must! Oh, come back, Ratty!
Please, please come back!’
</p><p>
The Rat was too far ahead to hear clearly what the Mole
was calling. And he too could smell something — something like coming snow.
</p><p>
‘Mole, we mustn’t stop now, really!’ he called back.
‘We’ll come for it tomorrow, whatever it is. But I can’t stop
now — it’s late, and the snow’s coming on again, and I’m
afraid of losing the way! And I want your nose, Mole, so
come on, quick!’ Saying this, the Rat kept walking without
waiting for an answer.
</p><p>
Poor Mole stood alone in the road, and a big cry was
gathering somewhere low down inside him. But even under
such a test as this his loyalty to his friend stood firm. He
followed the Rat.
</p><p>
The Rat began chattering about what they could do back
home, and about the fire, and what a supper he wanted to
eat. He didn’t notice his friend’s silence and distressful face.
At last, he stopped and said kindly, ‘Look here, Mole old
chap, you seem very tired. We’ll sit down here for a minute
and rest. The snow isn’t coming so far, and the biggest part
of our journey is over.’
</p><p>
The Mole sat on a fallen tree and tried to control himself.
But the cry was winning, and poor Mole gave up, and cried
freely and helplessly and openly, now that he knew it was
all over.
</p><p>
It was a shock for the Rat. He did not speak for a while.
At last he said, very quietly, ‘What is it, old fellow? Tell me
your trouble, and let me see what I can do.’
</p><p>
Poor Mole answered with difficulty, ‘I know it’s a — dull,
dirty little place,’ he said at last, brokenly: ‘not like — your
cozy house — or Toad’s beautiful hall — or Badger’s great
house — but it was my own little home — and I was fond of
it. I smelt it suddenly — on the road, when I called and you
didn’t listen, Rat — and everything came back to me — and
I WANTED it! — O dear, O dear! — and when you DIDN’T
turn back, Ratty — I left it, though I was smelling it all the
time. — Why didn’t we just go and have one look at it, Ratty? — Only one look — it was near — but you didn’t turn
back, Ratty, you didn’t turn back! O dear, O dear!’
</p><p>
Remembering brought new crying, and he couldn’t
speaklongen
</p><p>
The Rat looked straight in front of him, saying nothing,
only patting Mole gently on the shoulder. After a time he
said, ‘I see it all now! What a PIG I was! Just a pig!’
</p><p>
He waited till Mole’s crying became gradually less
stormy; he waited till it stopped. Then he stood up, said,
‘Let’s go, old chap! We’re going to find it!’ and went up the
road again.
</p><p>
‘Oh, come back, Ratty!’ cried the Mole, getting up and run-
ning after him. ‘It’s too late, and too dark, and the place is too
far off, and the snow’s coming! And — and I never meant to
let you know I was feeling that way about it — it was all a
mistake! And think of River Bank, and your supper!’
</p><p>
‘Oh no!’ said the Rat. ‘I tell you, I’m going to find this
place now. So cheer up, old chap, and take my arm, and we’ll
very soon be back there again.’
</p><p>
Mole let the Rat pull him along the road, and his friend
kept talking cheerfully. Then the Rat said, ‘Now, no more
talking. Business! Use your nose.’
</p><p>
They moved on in silence for a while, when suddenly the
Mole stopped. His nose felt the air. Then he set off.
</p><p>
The Rat followed the Mole, who with the look of a
sleep-walker crossed a dry ditch, got through a hedge, and
nosed his way across a field.
</p><p>
Suddenly, he went down; the Rat followed him down the
tunnel to which Mole’s nose was leading him.
</p><p>
It was close and the earthy smell was strong, and it
seemed a long time to Rat before the tunnel ended and he
could stand up and shake himself. The Rat saw that they
were standing in an open space, clean and sanded underfoot, and in front of them was Mole’s little door and a sign
‘Mole End’.
</p><p>
Mole took a lamp from the wall and lit it... and the Rat,
looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of yard.
</p><p>
Mole smiled and led Rat through the door, lit a lamp in
the hall, and looked round his old home. He saw the dust
lying thick on everything, and fell again on a hall-chair, his
nose to his paws. ‘O Ratty!’ he cried, ‘why did I bring you to
this poor, cold little place instead of River Bank?’
</p><p>
The Rat paid no attention to it. He was running here and
there, opening doors, inspecting rooms and cupboards,
and lighting lamps. ‘What a great little house this is!’ he
called out cheerfully. ‘Everything here and everything in
its place! We’ll make a joyful night of it. The first thing we
want is a good fire; I’ll see to that — I always know where
to find things. So this is the living-room. Beautiful! Your
own idea, those little sleeping beds in the wall? Great!
</p><p>
Now, I’ll take the wood and the coals, and you get a duster,
Mole — and try and clean things up a bit. Move about, old
chapV
</p><p>
The Mole rose and dusted and polished with energy,
and the Rat soon had a cheerful fire. He called the Mole to
come and warm himself; but Mole had another cry, hiding
his face in his duster. ‘Rat,’ he said, ‘how about your supper,
you poor, cold, hungry, tired animal? I have nothing to give
you — nothing!’
</p><p>
‘Why, I see a sardine-opener on the kitchen table,’ said
the Rat, ‘and everybody knows that means there are sardines about somewhere. Come with me and look.’
</p><p>
They went, hunting through every cupboard and turning out every box. They found a tin of sardines — a box of
biscuits, nearly full — and a German sausage in silver paper.
</p><p>
‘There’s a banquet for you!’ said the Rat, as he laid the
table. ‘I know some animals who would give their ears to be
sitting down to supper with us tonight!’
</p><p>
‘No bread!’ cried the Mole; ‘no butter, no—’
</p><p>
‘No cream-cakes, no champagne!’ continued the Rat,
smiling. ‘This is really the happiest little place I ever was
in. Now, where did you pick up those prints? They make
the place look so home-like. No wonder you’re so fond of
it, Mole. Tell me all about it, and how you came to make it
what it is.’
</p><p>
The Mole, a little shyly at first, told how he planned, and
how he thought, and how he got this from an aunt, and that
was a wonderful find, and how he bought this other thing.
He took a lamp to show them off to his visitor, quite forgetful of the supper they both so much needed; Rat, who
was very hungry but tried not to show it, kept examining
everything seriously, and saying, ‘Wonderful,’ and ‘most
beautiful,’ at intervals.
</p><p>
At last they returned to the table, and the Rat was busy
with the sardine-opener when they heard the sounds from
the yard — sounds like pattering of small feet and little
voices — ‘Now, all in a line — hold the lamp up a bit, Tommy — after I say one, two, three. — Where’s young Bill? —
Here, come on, we’re all waiting—’
</p><p>
‘What’s up?’ asked the Rat.
</p><p>
‘I think it must be the field-mice,’ replied the Mole, with
pride. ‘They go round carol-singing regularly at this time of
the year. And they never forget me — they come to Mole End
last of all; and I usually give them hot drinks, and supper too
sometimes. It will be like old times to hear them again.’
</p><p>
‘Let’s have a look at them!’ cried the Rat, jumping up and
running to the door.
</p><p>
In the yard, some eight or ten little field mice stood, red
warm scarves round their necks, their paws deep into their
pockets, their feet dancing for warmth. With bright eyes
they looked shyly at each other. As the door opened, one of
the elder ones that carried the lamp was just saying, ‘Now
then, one, two, three!’ and their little voices rose on the air,
singing one of the old-time carols.
</p><p>
The voices stopped, the singers, smiling, exchanged
looks. Then, from up above and far away, there came the
sound of distant bells ringing.
</p><p>
‘Very well, boys!’ cried the Rat. ‘And now come in, all of
you, and warm yourselves by the fire, and have something
hot!’
</p><p>
‘Yes, come along, field-mice,’ cried the Mole. ‘This is
quite like old times! Now, you just wait a minute, while 
we — O, Ratty!’ he cried, falling on a seat, with tears gathering. ‘What are we doing? We have nothing to give them!’
</p><p>
‘You leave all that to me,’ said the Rat. ‘Here, you with the
lamp! Now, tell me, are there any shops open at this hour
of the night?’
</p><p>
‘Why, certainly, sir,’ replied the field-mouse respectfully. ‘At
this time of the year our shops keep open to all sorts of hours.’
</p><p>
‘Then look here!’ said the Rat. ‘You go off at once, you
and your lamp, and you get me—’
</p><p>
Here the Mole only heard parts of it, such as — ‘Fresh,
mind — no, a pound of that enough — no, only the best —
well then, do the best you can!’ Finally, there was a sound
of coin passing from paw to paw, the field-mouse took a big
basket and left.
</p><p>
The rest of the field-mice sat down close to the fire; the
Mole went into family history and made each of them tell
the names of his many brothers, who were too young to go
out carol-singing this year. The Rat, meanwhile, was busy;
and soon every field-mouse was drinking hot tea and laughing and forgetting he was ever cold in all his life.
</p><p>
‘They act plays too, these fellows,’ the Mole said to the
Rat. ‘Make them up all by themselves, and act them. They
gave us a great one last year, about a field-mouse whom a pirate caught at sea, and made him row in a galleyz; and when
he escaped and got home again, he found his lady-love in a
monastery. Here, YOU! You were in it, I remember. Get up
and read a bit.’
</p><p>
The field-mouse got up, laughed shyly, looked round the
room, and couldn’t say a word. They were all busy cheering
him up, when the door opened, and the field-mouse with
the lamp appeared with his basket.
</p><p>
There was no more talk of play-acting when the con-
tents of the basket were out on the table. In a very few
minutes supper was ready, and they ate, and talked of old
times, and the field-mice gave the Mole the local news, and
answered as well as they could the hundred questions he
asked them. The Rat said little or nothing, only taking care
that each guest had what he wanted, and a lot of it, and that
Mole had no trouble about anything.
</p><p>
They left at last, very grateful and with their jacket pockets full of sweets for the small brothers and sisters at home.
When the door closed on the last of them, Mole and Rat sat
down near the fire and discussed the long day. At last the
Rat said, ‘Mole, old chap, I’m ready to fall. Is that your own
bed over there? Very well, then, I’ll take this one. What a
nice little house this is! Everything so near!’
</p><p>
He got into his bed and instantly fell asleep.
</p><p>
The tired Mole also was glad to have his head on his
pillow, in great joy and peace. But before he closed his eyes
he let them go round his old room, on friendly things which
were long a part of him, and now smilingly welcomed him
back. He saw clearly how ordinary and simple it all was;
but clearly, too, how much it all meant to him. He did not
at all want to forget the new life and its wonderful places,
to turn his back on sun and air. But it was good to think he
had this place to come back to; these things which were so
glad to see him again and could always give him the same
simple welcome.

<h3><span>CHAPTER VI</span> Mr. Toad</h3>
<div>



<p>
It was a bright morning in the early part of summer. The 
Mole and the Water Rat were getting ready for the 
opening of the boating season; painting and cleaning,
repairing, hunting for missing details, and so on. They
were finishing breakfast in their little room and discussing their plans for the day, when a heavy knock sounded
at the door.
</p><p>
The Mole went to open, and the Rat heard him cry
out in surprise. Then he said with much importance, ‘Mr.
Badger!’
</p><p>
This was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger paid
a formal call on them, or indeed on anybody. The Badger
walked heavily into the room, and stood looking at the two
animals with an expression full of seriousness. The Rat
dropped his egg-spoon on the table-cloth.
</p><p>
‘I’m ready!’ said the Badger at last.
</p><p>
‘Ready! For what?’ asked the Rat uneasily.
</p><p>
‘Why, for Toad!’ answered the Badger. ‘I said, “I’m going
to take him in hand in spring,” and I’m going to take him in
hand today!’
</p><p>
‘Of course!’ cried the Mole. ‘I remember now! WE’LL
teach him to be a clever Toad!’
</p><p>
‘This morning,’ continued the Badger, taking an armchair,
‘another new and very powerful car will arrive at Toad Hall.
At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is changing from a
(comparatively) good-looking Toad into a horrible Object. 
We must act, before it is too late. You will accompany
me to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue must begin.’
</p><p>
‘Right you are!’ cried the Rat, starting up. ‘We’ll rescue
the poor unhappy animal!’
</p><p>
They set offup the road on their mission, Badger leading
the way.
</p><p>
They reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find a
new bright-red car, of great size, standing in front of the
house. As they neared the door it opened, and Mr. Toad, in
driver’s glasses, cap, and enormous overcoat, came down
the steps, pulling on his gloves.
</p><p>
‘Hullo!’ he cried cheerfully. ‘You’re just in time to come
with me for a happy—’
</p><p>
He didn’t finish the sentence as he saw the serious look
on the faces of his friends.
</p><p>
The Badger came up the steps. ‘Take him inside,’ he said
to his companions. Then, as Toad was fighting and protesting, he turned to the driver of the new car.
</p><p>
‘I’m afraid Mr. Toad will not need the car today. You
needn’t wait,’ he said and followed the others inside and
shut the door.
</p><p>
‘Now then!’ he said to Toad, when the four ofthem stood
together in the Hall, ‘first of all, take those funny things off!’
</p><p>
‘I will not!’ replied Toad, with great emotion. ‘What is
the meaning of this?’
</p><p>
‘Take them off him, then, you two,’ said the Badger.
</p><p>
They made Toad lie down on the ﬂoor, and he was fighting and calling them all sorts of names. Then the Rat sat
on him, and the Mole got his car-clothes off him bit by bit,
and they stood him up on his legs again. A lot of his emotions seemed to leave him with his fine clothes. Now hewas
 merely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Road. He
smiled and looked from one to the other, seeming quite to
understand the situation.
</p><p>
‘You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad,’
the Badger said. ‘You didn’t listen to us, you were losing
your money, and you’re getting us animals a bad name in
the district by your terrible driving and your smashes and
your arguments with the police. We animals never allow
our friends to make fools of themselves. I’ll make one more
effort to bring you to reason. You will come with me into the
room, and there you will hear some facts about yourself;
and I hope they will help you to change your mind.’
</p><p>
He took Toad by the arm, led him into the room, and
closed the door behind them.
</p><p>
‘THAT’S no good!’ said the Rat. ‘TALKING to Toad’ll never
change him. He’ll SAY anything.’
</p><p>
They made themselves comfortable in armchairs and
waited. Through the closed door they could just hear the
sound of the Badger’s voice, and then they also heard the
crying from Toad.
</p><p>
After some three-quarters of an hour the door opened,
and the Badger reappeared, leading by the paw a very weak
Toad. His legs were shaking, and there were tears on his
cheeks.
</p><p>
‘Sit down there, Toad,’ said the Badger kindly, pointing
to a chair. ‘My friends,’ he went on, ‘I am happy to inform
you that Toad is truly sorry for his conduct in the past, and
he is going to give up cars forever.’
</p><p>
‘That is very good news,’ said the Mole.
</p><p>
‘Very good news,’ said the Rat doubtfully, ‘if only — IF
only—’
</p><p>
He was looking at Toad as he said this.
</p><p>
‘There’s only one thing more,’ continued the Badger.
‘Toad, I want you to repeat it, before your friends here. First,
are you sorry for your conduct?’
</p><p>
There was a long, long pause. Toad looked this way and
that, while the other animals waited. At last he spoke.
</p><p>
‘No!’ he said; ‘I’m NOT sorry. And it wasn’t wrong at all!
It was simply wonderful!’
</p><p>
‘What?’ cried the Badger in surprise. ‘Didn’t you tell me
just now, in there—’
</p><p>
‘Oh, yes, yes, in THERE,’ said Toad quickly. ‘I said anything in THERE. You’re so moving, dear Badger — you can
do what you like with me in THERE, and you know it. But
now I find that I’m not a bit sorry really, so it’s no good
saying I am, is it?’
</p><p>
‘Then you don’t promise,’ said the Badger, ‘never to
touch a car again?’
</p><p>
‘Certainly not!’ answered Toad emotionally. ‘On the contrary, I promise to go off in the very first car I see!’
</p><p>
‘Told you so, didn’t I?’ said the Rat to the Mole.
</p><p>
‘Very well, then,’ said the Badger, rising to his feet. ‘As you
won’t listen, we’ll try what force can do. You often asked us three
to come and stay with you, Toad, in this beautiful house; well,
now we’re going to. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up
in his bedroom, while we arrange matters between ourselves.’
</p><p>
‘It’s for your own good, Toady, you know,’ said the Rat
kindly, as they were leading the struggling Toad upstairs.
‘Think what fun we will have together, just as before, when
you are over it!’
</p><p>
‘We’ll take great care of everything for you till you’re
well, Toad,’ said the Mole; ‘and we’ll see your money is safe.’
</p><p>
‘No more of those incidents with the police, Toad,’ said
the Rat, as they put him into his bedroom.
</p><p>
‘And no more weeks in hospital, Toad,’ finished the Mole,
turning the key on him.
</p><p>
Then they met in conference on the situation.
</p><p>
‘It’s going to be a difficult business,’ said the Badger. ‘Toad
is really hard this time. Well, we will see it out. We will take
turns to be with him, till the poison goes out of his system.’
</p><p>
They arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it
in turns to sleep in Toad’s room at night, and they divided
the day up between them. At first Toad was very hard to his
careful guardians. He set bedroom chairs to look like a car
and sat on the first of them, looking fixedly ahead, making
noises, till he reached the peak, when, turning a complete
somersault, he lay among the ruins of the chairs, apparently
quite happy for the moment. As time passed, these games
became fewer, and his friends tried to interest him in something else. But his interest in other matters did not seem to
last, and he grew depressed.
</p><p>
One fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to keep
watch, went upstairs to change Badger. ‘Toad’s still in bed,’
he told the Rat, outside the door. ‘Can’t get much out of him,
except, ”O leave me alone, I want nothing, perhaps I’ll be better in time,” and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When Toad’s
quiet, then he’s foxy. I know him. Well, now, I must go.’
</p><p>
‘How are you today, old chap?’ asked the Rat cheerfully,
as he came to Toad’s bedside.
</p><p>
He waited some minutes for an answer. At last a weak
voice answered, ‘Thank you so much, dear Ratty! So good
of you to ask! But first tell me how you are yourself, and the
excellent Mole?’
</p><p>
‘O, WE’RE all right,’ answered the Rat. ‘Mole is going out
for a run with Badger. They’ll be out till lunch time, so you
and I will spend a pleasant morning together. Now jump up,
there’s a good fellow, and don’t lie there on a fine morning
like this!’
</p><p>
‘Dear, kind Rat,’ said Toad, ‘how little you understand my
feelings, and how very far I am from “jumping up” now! But
do not trouble about me. I hate to be a trouble to my friends,
and I will not be one much longer.’
</p><p>
‘Well, I hope not,’ said the Rat. ‘I’m glad to hear it’s going
to stop. And in weather like this, and the boating season just
beginning! It’s too bad of you, Toad! It isn’t the trouble we
mind, but you’re making us miss such a lot.’
</p><p>
‘I’m afraid it IS the trouble you mind,’ said the Toad. ‘I
can quite understand it. It’s natural enough. You’re tired of
me. I mustn’t ask you to do anything further.’
</p><p>
‘But I tell you, I will take any trouble for you, just be a
serious animal.’
</p><p>
‘If only I could ask you, Ratty,’ said Toad, weaker than
ever, ‘—for the last time, probably — to go to the village as
quickly as possible — even now it may be too late — and
bring the doctor.’
</p><p>
‘Why, what do you want a doctor for?’ asked the Rat,
coming nearer and examining him. He certainly lay very
still and ﬂat, and his voice was weak.
</p><p>
‘Of course you noticed of late—’ said Toad. ‘But, no —
never mind — forget what I asked.’
</p><p>
‘Look here, old chap,’ said the Rat, beginning to get nervous, ‘of course I’ll bring a doctor to you. But you can’t be bad
enough for that yet. Let’s talk about something else.’
</p><p>
‘I think, dear friend,’ said Toad, with a sad smile, ‘that
“talk” can do little in a case like this. And, by the way — I
HATE to give you more trouble, but could you at the same
time ask the lawyer to come up?’
</p><p>
‘A lawyer! O, he must be really bad!’ the Rat said to himself, as he ran from the room, not forgetting to shut the door
carefully behind him.
</p><p>
Outside, he stopped to think. The other two were far
away, and he had no one to consult.
</p><p>
‘It’s best to be on the safe side,’ he said. ‘I know Toad
showed off bad before; but I never heard him ask for a lawyer! Iwill better go; it won’t take very long.’ So he ran off to
the village.
</p><p>
The Toad jumped lightly out of bed and watched him
from the window till he disappeared. Then, laughing loudly,
he dressed as quickly as possible, filled his pockets with
money, and next, binding the sheets from his bed together,
he got out, and, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, set
off, singing a merry song.
</p><p>
The Rat was very unhappy telling the Badger and the
Mole his pitiful story. ‘He did it terribly well,’ said the depressed Rat.
</p><p>
‘He fooled you terribly well!’ said the Badger hotly. ‘But
talking won’t change anything. He’s away for the time,
that’s certain; and the worst of it is, he’ll be so happy with
his cleverness that he may make any mistake. One comfort
is, we’re free now, and needn’t lose any more of our time.
Let’s stay at Toad Hall for a while longer. Toad may appear
at any moment — between two policemen, or two doctors.’
</p><p>
So spoke the Badger, not knowing what the future prepared for them.
</p><p>
At that time Toad was walking happily along the road,
some miles from home. ‘Clever piece of work!’ he said to
himself smiling. ‘Brain against force — and brain is the winner. Poor old Ratty! The Badger will be so angry with him!
A nice fellow, Ratty, with many good qualities, but no brains
and absolutely no education. I must take him in hand some
day, and see ifI can make something of him.’
</p><p>
Full of proud thoughts, he walked along till he reached
a little town. There he came into a café, ordered the best
lunch, and sat down to eat it in the coffee-room.
</p><p>
Suddenly a well-known sound, approaching down the
street, made him jump. The poop-poop! nearer and nearer,
the car turned into the yard and stopped, and Toad held on
to the leg ofthe table to hide his emotion. The party entered
the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and happy. Toad listened
for a time; at last he went out of the room quietly, paid his
bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside, came quietly
to the yard. ‘There cannot be any harm,’ he said to himself,
‘in my only just LOOKING at it!’
</p><p>
The car stood in the middle of the yard, and there was
no one near it. Toad walked slowly round it, inspecting, criticizing, thinking deeply.
</p><p>
‘Does it START easily, I wonder?’ he said to himself.
</p><p>
Next moment, hardly knowing how it happened, he
found he was in the car. As if in a dream he found himself in
the driver’s seat; as if in a dream, he drove the car out of the
yard. All sense of right and wrong, all fear disappeared. As
the car jumped along on the road through the open country,
he only felt that he was Toad once more, Toad the terror of
the road. He sang, not thinking of what might come to him.
</p><p>
******
</p><p>
‘I think,’ said the Judge, ‘the ONLY difficulty in this very
clear case is, how we can punish the bandit whom we see
before us. Let me see: first, he stole an expensive car; second, was driving to the public danger; and, third, conflicted
with the police. Mr. Clerk, will you tell us, please, what is the
hardest punishment we can give for each of these crimes?’
</p><p>
The Clerk scratched his nose with his pen. ‘You may say
twelve months for the stealing, which is mild; and three
years for the dangerous driving, which is kind; and fifteen
years for the quarrel with the police, which was pretty bad
sort — those figures, if we add them together, make up to
nineteen years, so you better make it a round twenty years.’
</p><p>
‘A great plan!’ said the Judge. ‘Toad! It’s going to be twen-
ty years for you this time.’
</p><p>
Then they led the unhappy Toad, crying and protesting,
to the door of the darkest underground prison.
</p>

<h3><span>CHAPTER VII</span> The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</h3>
<div>



<p>
It was past ten o’clock at night, midsummer night. Mole lay
on the bank, still resting from the stress of the hot day,
I and waited for his friend. He left the Water Rat with Otter;
and came back to find the house dark and empty. It was still
too hot to think of staying indoors, so he lay on some cool 
leaves, and thought over the past day and its doings, and
how very good they all were.
</p><p>
The Rat’s light footfall approached over the grass. ‘O, the
wonderful coolness!’ he said, and sat down.
</p><p>
‘You stayed to supper, of course?’ said the Mole.
</p><p>
‘Yes,’ said the Rat. ‘You know how kind they always are.
And they made things as happy for me as ever they could,
right up to the moment I left. But I felt bad all the time, as it
was clear to me they were very unhappy, though they tried
to hide it. Mole, I’m afraid they’re in trouble. Little Portly
is missing again; and you know how much his father cares
about him, though he never says much about it.’
</p><p>
‘What, that child?’ said the Mole lightly. ‘He’s always
walking off and getting lost, and coming back again. But
no harm ever happens to him. Everybody knows him and
likes him, and some animal or other will come across him
and bring him back again all right. Why, we found him ourselves, miles from home, and quite happy!’
</p><p>
‘Yes; but this time it’s more serious,’ said the Rat. ‘He’s missing
for some days now, and the Otters hunted everywhere without finding him. And they asked every animal for miles around,
and no one knows anything about him. Otter’s nervous. You
know, young Portly can’t swim very well yet. There’s a lot of water coming down still, and the place was always interesting for
the child. And then there are — well, things — YOU know. Ot-
ter’s not the fellow to be nervous about his sons. And now he IS
nervous. He is going to spend the night watching by the old ford.’
</p><p>
‘I know it very well,’ said the Mole. ‘But why did Otter
choose to watch there?’
</p><p>
‘Well, it was there he gave Portly his first swimming-lesson,’ answered the Rat. ‘And it was there he taught him fishing.
 The child loves the place, and Otter thinks he might
come there. So Otter goes there every night and watches.’
</p><p>
They didn’t speak for some time, both thinking of the
same thing — the lonely, sad animal, sitting by the ford,
watching and waiting the long night through.
</p><p>
‘Well, well,’ said the Rat, ‘I think we must go to bed.’ But
he didn’t move.
</p><p>
‘Rat,’ said the Mole, ‘I simply can’t go and sleep, and DO
nothing. We’ll get the boat out, and row up stream. The moon
will be up in an hour or so, and then we will look as well as
we can — anyhow, it will be better than going to bed and
doing NOTHING.’
</p><p>
‘Iust what I was thinking myself,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s not
the sort of night for bed anyhow.’
</p><p>
They got the boat out and set off. The night was full of small
noises, song and chatter, telling of the busy little animals who
were up and about. They heard the water’s own noises, too.
</p><p>
The friends landed in this silent, silver kingdom, and explored the hedges, the trees, the tunnels, the ditches and dry
water-ways.
</p><p>
Then the horizon became clearer, field and tree came
more into sight, and somehow with a different look. Suddenly they heard sweet music and followed it. Mole rowed,
and soon they came to a point where the river divided.
</p><p>
On either side of them they saw the rich meadow-grass.
In the middle of the river, behind the willows, lay a small island. Slowly, the two animals stopped their boat at the ﬂow-
ery side of the island. In silence they landed, and pushed
through the ﬂowers and grass.
</p><p>
‘This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music
played to me,’ said the Rat, as if in a dream.
</p><p>
Then suddenly the Mole felt something great fall upon
him, that changed his muscles to water. It was no panic terror — indeed he felt wonderfully at peace and happy — but
without seeing, he knew it could only mean that some great
Presence was very, very near. With difficulty he turned to
look for his friend and saw him at his side shocked.
</p><p>
He raised his head; and then, in that clearness of the
early morning he looked in the very eyes ofthe Friend and
Helper; he saw the big nose between the kindly eyes that
were looking down on them, while the bearded mouth
broke into a half-smile at the corners; saw the muscles on
the arm that lay across the broad chest, the long hand still
holding the pan-pipes; saw, last of all, between his very
feet, sleeping in peace, the little, round, childish form of
the baby otter. All this he saw, for one moment.
</p><p>
‘Rat!’ he said, shaking. ‘Are you afraid?’
</p><p>
‘Afraid?’ answered the Rat, his eyes shining with love.
‘Afraid! Of HIM? O, never, never! And yet — and yet — O,
Mole, I am afraid!’
</p><p>
Then the two animals bowed their heads.
</p><p>
The sun’s broad golden disc showed itself over the horizon facing them. When they could see once more, the Vision
disappeared, and the air was full of the carol of birds.
</p><p>
As they looked, a little wind, dancing up from the water,
shook the roses and blew lightly in their faces; and with
its soft touch came forgetfulness. Mole rubbed his eyes and
looked at Rat. ‘I beg your pardon; what did you say, Rat?’
he asked.
</p><p>
‘I think I was only saying,’ the Rat said slowly, ‘that this
was the right sort of place to find Portly. And look! There he
is!’ And with a cry ofjoy he ran towards the sleeping Portly.
</p><p>
But Mole stood still a moment, deep in thought. He
seemed to be trying to remember a beautiful dream, but
he could remember nothing but a sense of the beauty of it.
So Mole shook his head sadly and followed the Rat.
</p><p>
Portly woke up, and laughed with pleasure at the sight
of his father’s friends. But in a moment his face grew sad,
and he fell to hunting round in a circle. As a child that falls
happily asleep in its nurse’s arms, and wakes to find itself
alone and in a strange place, and runs from room to room,
so Portly ran about the island, till at last the black moment
came for giving it up, and sitting down and crying.
</p><p>
The Mole ran quickly to comfort the little animal. Portly
was soon quiet, thinking of a trip on the river in Mr. Rat’s
real boat; and the two animals led him to the water’s side,
placed him securely between them in the bottom of the
boat, and rowed off. The sun was fully up by now, birds
sang, and ﬂowers smiled.
</p><p>
As they drew near the ford, the Mole took the boat into
the bank, and they lifted Portly out and set him on his legs,
gave a friendly pat on the back, and rowed out into mid-
stream. They watched the little animal till they saw his walk
break into a run. Looking up the river, they could see Otter
stand up, and could hear his joyous cry. So they let the full
stream bear them down again.
</p><p>
‘I feel strangely tired, Rat,’ said the Mole. ‘I feel as ifI was
in something very exciting and even terrible; but nothing
happened}
</p><p>
‘Or something very surprising and beautiful,’ said the
Rat, closing his eyes. ‘I feel just as you do, Mole. It’s lucky
the stream takes us home. Isn’t it great to feel the sun again!
And the wind playing in the trees!’
</p><p>
‘It’s like music — faraway music,’ said the Mole dreamily.
</p><p>
‘So I was thinking,’ said the Rat. ‘Dance-music — but with
words in it, too — it goes into words and out of them again —
then it is dance-music once more, and then nothing.’
</p><p>
‘You hear better than I,’ said the Mole sadly. ‘I cannot catch
the words.’
</p><p>
‘Let me try and give you them,’ said the Rat softly, his
eyes still closed. ‘Helper and friend, I cheer — Small animals wet — Asking them all forget! No, it is no good; the
song stopped.’
</p><p>
‘But what do the words mean?’ asked the wondering Mole.
</p><p>
‘That I do not know,’ said the Rat simply. ‘I passed them on
to you as they reached me. Ah! now they return again! This
time, at last, it is the real thing, simple — perfect—’
</p><p>
‘Well, let’s have it, then,’ said the Mole, after he waited
patiently for a few minutes, half-sleeping in the hot sun.
</p><p>
But no answer came. He looked, and understood the si-
lence. With a happy smile on his face, the tired Rat was asleep.

<h3><span>CHAPTER VIII</span> Toad’s Adventures</h3>
<div>



<p>
When Toad found himself in a dark prison, he fell on
Wthe ﬂoor, and cried. ‘This is the end of everything’ 
(he said), ‘or it is the end of the career of Toad,
which is the same thing; the popular and handsome Toad, the
rich Toad, the Toad so free! Now I must stay in this prison, till
people who were proud to say they knew me forget my name!
</p><p>
O clever old Badger!’ (he said), ‘O clever, intelligent Rat and
Mole! O unhappy Toad!’ With such cries he spent his days and
nights for several weeks, refusing his meals.
</p><p>
The prison guard had a daughter, a pleasant and kind
girl, who assisted her father. She was very fond of animals,
and, besides her canary, she had several mice and a squirrel. This kind girl, pitying Toad, said to her father one day,
‘Father! I can’t see that poor animal so unhappy, and getting
so thin! Let me take care of him. I’ll make him eat from my
hand, and sit up, and do all sorts of things.’
</p><p>
Her father agreed. He was tired of Toad and his cries. So
that day she knocked at the Toad’s door.
</p><p>
‘Now, cheer up, Toad,’ she said, on entering, ‘and sit up and
dry your eyes. Here’s some food for you, right from the stove!’
</p><p>
The smell of cabbage reached the nose ofToad, and gave
him the idea for a moment that perhaps life was not such
a bad thing after all. But still he cried, and kicked with his
legs, and refused any comfort. So the clever girl left for the
time, but, of course, the smell of hot cabbage stayed, and
Toad, between his cries, began to think new thoughts: of
poetry; of broad meadows, and sun and wind; and of the
comforting sound of dishes on the table at Toad Hall, and
the scrape ofchair-legs on the floor as everyone pulled himself close up to the table. He began to think of his friends,
and how they could do something; and lastly, he thought of
his own great cleverness, and all that he could do with it;
and the cure was almost complete.
</p><p>
When the girl returned, some hours later, she carried
a tray, with a cup of tea; and a plate with very hot toast,
cut thick, very brown on both sides, with butter running
through the holes in it in great golden drops, like honey. The 
smell of that toast simply talked to Toad; talked of warm
kitchens, of breakfasts on bright frosty mornings, of cozy
room firesides on winter evenings. Toad sat up, dried his
eyes, drank his tea and ate his toast, and soon began talking
freely about himself, and his house, and his doings there,
and how important he was.
</p><p>
The guard’s daughter saw that the topic was doing him
as much good as the tea.
</p><p>
‘Tell me about Toad Hall,’ she said. ‘It sounds beautiful.
But first wait till I bring you some more tea and toast.’
</p><p>
She returned with a fresh tray; and Toad, eating the
toast, told her about the boat-house, and the fish-pond,
and the hen-house, and the wash-house; and about the
banqueting-hall, and all the fun, and his friends. Then she
wanted to know about his animal-friends. Of course, she
did not say she was fond of animals as PETS. When she said
good night, Toad was quite cheerful once again. He sang a
little song or two, and had an excellent night’s rest and the
pleasantest of dreams.
</p><p>
They had many interesting talks together, after that, as
the days went on; and the guard’s daughter grew very sorry
for Toad.
</p><p>
‘Toad,’ she said one morning, ‘just listen, please. Ihave
an aunt who is a washerwoman.’
</p><p>
‘Never mind,’ said Toad, ‘don’t think about it. I have several aunts who MUST be washerwomen.’
</p><p>
‘Be quiet a minute, Toad,’ said the girl. ‘You talk too much,
and I’m trying to think. I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all the prisoners here. She takes
out the washing on Monday morning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. You’re very rich — at least 
you’re always telling me so — and she’s very poor. A few
pounds won’t make any difference to you, and it will mean a
lot to her. Maybe she will let you have her dress and hat and
so on, and you could escape from the prison as the official
washerwoman.’
</p><p>
‘You don’t mean Mr. Toad of Toad Hall will have to go
about the country dressed as a washerwoman!’
</p><p>
‘Then you can stop here as a Toad,’ said the girl hotly.
</p><p>
Honest Toad was always ready to see his mistakes. ‘You
are a good, kind, clever girl,’ he said, ‘and I am a proud and
stupid toad. Will you introduce me to your aunt, please? No
doubt the excellent lady and I will organize everything.’
</p><p>
The next evening the girl took her aunt to Toad. In return
for his money, Toad got a cotton dress, an apron, a shawl,
and an ugly black hat. Then they bound and gagged the old
lady to make it look like an attack.
</p><p>
‘Now it’s your turn, Toad,’ said the girl. ‘Take off your
coat and waistcoat and change.’
</p><p>
Shaking with laughter, she helped him to change.
</p><p>
‘You’re the portrait of her,’ she laughed, ‘Now, good-bye,
Toad, and good luck. Go straight down the way you came up;
and remember you’re a woman, quite alone in the world.’
</p><p>
With a shaking heart but firm footstep Toad went forward. It seemed hours before he crossed the last yard,
heard the key in the great outer door click behind him, felt
the fresh air of the outer world upon his face, and knew that
he was free!
</p><p>
He walked quickly towards the lights of the town, not
knowing what to do next. As he walked along, he saw some
red and green lights a little way off, and heard the sound of
the puffing of engines. ‘Aha!’ he thought, ‘A railway station 
is the thing I want most at this moment; and what’s more,
I needn’t go through the town to get it.’
</p><p>
He made his way to the station, looked at a timetable,
and found that a train in the direction of his home was going to start in half-an-hour.
</p><p>
He was going to buy a ticket to the station nearest to
Toad Hall. But as he reached for his waistcoat pocket where
he kept his money he felt only the cotton dress. He had no
money!
</p><p>
He said to the clerk, ‘Look here! I left my money behind.
Just give me that ticket, and I’ll send the money tomorrow.’
</p><p>
‘Stand away from the window, please, madam; you’re
disturbing the other passengers!’ the clerk answered.
</p><p>
Sad and full of anger, he went down the platform where
the train was standing, and tears fell down each side of his
nose. Very soon they will discover his escape, the hunt will
start, they will catch him, and put him back again to prison
and bread-and-water; and O, what sarcastic comments the
girl will make! What must he do?
</p><p>
As he thought, he found himself near the engine and its
driver.
</p><p>
‘Hullo, mother!’ said the engine-driver, ‘what’s the trouble? You don’t look cheerful.’
</p><p>
‘O, sir!’ said Toad, crying again, ‘I am a poor unhappy
washerwoman, and Ilost all my money, and can’t pay for
a ticket, and I must get home tonight somehow, and I don’t
know what to do.’
</p><p>
‘Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,’ said the good engine-driver. ‘You’re a washerwoman. And I’m an engine-driver, as you
well may see, and it’s terribly dirty work. Will you wash a
few shirts for me when you get home, and send them along?
</p><p>
And I’ll give you a ride on my engine. It’s against the Company’s rules, but we’re not so very strict in these here.’
</p><p>
The Toad quickly got up into the cab of the engine. Of
course, he never washed a shirt in his life, and wasn’t going
to begin; but he thought: ‘When I get safely home to Toad
Hall, and have money again, and pockets to put it in, Iwill
send the engine-driver enough to pay for a lot of washing.’
</p><p>
The train moved out of the station. The Toad could see
on either side of him real fields, and trees, and hedges,
and cows, and horses, and as he thought how every min-
ute was bringing him nearer to Toad Hall, and his friends,
and money in his pocket, and a soft bed to sleep in, and
good things to eat, he began to jump up and down and sing
songs, to the great surprise of the engine-driver.
</p><p>
They covered many and many miles, and Toad was al-
ready thinking what to have for supper at home, when he
saw that the engine-driver, with a surprise on his face, was
looking over the side of the engine and listening hard. Then
he said to Toad: ‘It’s very strange; we’re the last train running
in this direction tonight, yet I hear another following us!’
</p><p>
Toad stopped jumping at once. By this time the moon
was shining brightly, and the engine-driver could see the
line behind them for a long distance.
</p><p>
He said, ‘I can see it clearly now! It is an engine, coming
along very quickly! It looks as if they follow us. And the engine
is full of the strangest men like guards, policemen in their
hats, and detectives, showing revolvers and walking-sticks;
and all crying the same thing — ”Stop, stop, stop!"’
</p><p>
Then Toad fell on his knees, raising his paws, and cried,
‘Save me, only save me, dear kind Mr. Engine-driver, and
I will tell you everything! I am not the simple washerwoman
 I seem to be! I am the well-known and popular Mr. Toad.
They want to catch me and put me back to prison!’
</p><p>
The engine-driver looked down upon him, and said,
‘Now tell the truth; what was your crime?’
</p><p>
‘I only took a car while the owners were at lunch; they
had no need of it at the time. I didn’t mean to steal it, really;
but people — especially judges — give such severe punish-
ments for thoughtless and emotional actions.’
</p><p>
The engine-driver looked very serious and said, ‘I think
that indeed you were a bad toad. But you are in great trouble and distress, so I will not leave you. I don’t like cars, and
I don’t like it when policemen tell me what to do on my own
engine. And an animal in tears always makes me feel pity. So
cheer up, Toad! I’ll do my best, and we may beat them yet!’
</p><p>
They threw on more coals, the engine ﬂew, but still the
policemen were close behind. The engine-driver said, ‘It’s
no good, Toad. They have the better engine. Now, a short
way ahead is a long tunnel, and on the other side is a thick
wood. I will go the quickest while we are running through
the tunnel. When we are on the other side, I will stop for a
second, and you jump and hide in the wood, before they get
through the tunnel and see you. Then I will go quick ahead
again, and they can follow me as far as they like. Be ready
to jump when I tell you!’
</p><p>
And so they did.
</p><p>
Toad saw his train disappear, and then the following
one. Then he had a great laugh.
</p><p>
But he soon stopped laughing when he saw that it was
very late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown
wood, with no money and no chance of supper, and still far
from his friends and home; and it was something ofa shock.
</p><p>
He got into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as
far as possible behind him. At last, cold, hungry, and tired,
he found an empty tree, made himself a comfortable bed of
dead leaves, and slept peacefully till the morning.

<h3><span>CHAPTER IX</span> Wayfarers All</h3>
<div>



<p>
The Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly 
know why. The summer was still at fullest height,
but there was a feeling in the air of change and 
departure. It was difficult to settle down to anything seriously. Leaving the waterside, he went to the country,
crossed a field or two, and dived into the great sea of
wheat, yellow, and full of quiet motion and small sounds.
He loved to walk here. Here, too, he had many small
friends, leading full and busy lives, but always with a moment to talk, and exchange news with a visitor. Today,
however, the field-mice were busy. Many were digging
and tunneling busily; others gathered together in small
groups and examined plans and drawings of small flats.
Some were pulling out dusty trunks, others were packing
their things. Piles of wheat, oats, barley, and nuts, lay
about ready for transport.
</p><p>
‘Here’s old Ratty!’ they cried as soon as they saw him.
‘Come and help us, Rat!’
</p><p>
‘What sort of games are you playing?’ said the Water Rat.
‘You know it isn’t time to be thinking of winter ﬂats yet!’
</p><p>
‘O yes, we know that,’ answered a field-mouse; ‘but we re-
ally MUST get all the furniture and baggage moved out of this
before those horrid machines begin clicking round the fields;
and then, you know, the best ﬂats get picked up so quickly nowadays, and all the rest need such a lot of doing up. Of course,
we’re early, we know that; but we’re only just making a start.’
</p><p>
‘O, forget it,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s a splendid day. Come for a
boat trip, or a walk, or a picnic in the woods, or something.’
</p><p>
‘Well, I THINK not TODAY, thank you,’ said the field-
mouse hurriedly. ‘Perhaps some OTHER day—’
</p><p>
The Rat went out of the field.
</p><p>
He returned to his river again — his old river, which
never packed up, or went into winter ﬂats.
</p><p>
In the willows he saw a swallow sitting. Then another
joined it, and then a third; and the birds talked together.
</p><p>
‘What, ALREADY,’ said the Rat, coming up to them.
‘What’s the hurry?’
</p><p>
‘O, we’re not leaving yet,’ answered the first swallow.
‘We’re only making plans and arranging things. Talking it
over, you know.’
</p><p>
‘Couldn’t you stop on for just this year?’ asked the Water Rat. ‘We’ll all do our best to make you feel at home. You
have no idea what good times we have here, while you are
far away.’
</p><p>
‘I tried “stopping on” one year,’ said another swallow.
‘For a few weeks it was well enough, but afterwards, O! The
cold, sunless days! The air so frosty, and not an insect in it!
No, it was no good; and one cold, one stormy night I had to
ﬂy away. I will never forget the happy feeling of the hot sun
again on my back, and the taste of my first fat insect! No,
never again I thought of staying.’
</p><p>
‘Ah, yes, the call ofthe South, ofthe South!’ twittered the
other swallows dreamily.
</p><p>
‘Why do you ever come back, then, at all?’ asked the Rat.
</p><p>
‘And do you think,’ said the first swallow, ‘that there is
no call of meadow-grass, gardens, warm ponds, and all the
farm-buildings?’
</p><p>
They went on talking of blue seas, brown sands, and
warm walls.
</p><p>
The Rat walked off once more. Footsteps fell on his ear,
and the figure of one that walked somewhat tiredly came into
view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty one. The
wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of something foreign about it — then with a pleasant smile turned
from the path and sat down by his side in the cool grass. He
seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest unquestioned, understanding something of what was in his thoughts.
</p><p>
The wayfarer was thin, and somewhat bowed at the
shoulders; his paws were thin and long, and he wore small
gold earrings in his ears. His sweater and breeches were
blue and his small possessions he carried in a blue cotton
handkerchief.
</p><p>
‘Those are cows we hear,’ the stranger said; ‘and over
there rises a blue line of cottage smoke against the woodland. The river runs somewhere close by. Everything seems
asleep, and yet going on all the time. It is a good life that
you lead, friend.’
</p><p>
‘Yes, it’s THE life, the only life, to live,’ answered the Water Rat dreamily.
</p><p>
‘It is the best,’ said the stranger; ‘I tried it, and I know.
And now here I am, tired and hungry, following the old call,
back to the old life, THE life which will not let me go.’
</p><p>
‘And where did you come from?’ the Rat asked.
</p><p>
‘Nice little farm,’ answered the wayfarer. ‘From that
direction’ — he showed to the north. ‘I had everything I
could want — everything I had any right to expect of life,
and more; and here I am! Glad to be here all the same! So
many miles further on the road, so many hours nearer to
my heart’s dream!’
</p><p>
His shining eyes looked to the horizon, and he seemed
to be listening for some sound.
</p><p>
‘You are not one of US,’ said the Water Rat. ‘You’re not a
farmer. I think you are a foreigner.’
</p><p>
‘Right,’ replied the stranger. ‘I’m a seafaring rat, and the
port Ioriginally am from is Constantinople, though I’m a
sort of a foreigner there too. The city of my birth is no more
my home than any pleasant port between there and the
London River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me
down on any of their shores, and I am home again.’
</p><p>
‘I think you go great voyages,’ said the Water Rat with
growing interest. ‘Months and months out of land, and 
provisions running short, and water too, and your mind speaking with the mighty ocean, and all that sort of thing?’
</p><p>
‘By no means,’ said the Sea Rat honestly. ‘Such a life as you
describe could not suit me at all. I’m in the coasting trade,
and rarely out of land. It’s the happy times on shore that
I like, as much as any seafaring. O, those southern seaports!’
</p><p>
‘Well, perhaps you chose the better way,’ said the Water
Rat doubtfully. ‘Tell me something of your coasting, then;
for my life, I must tell, feels to me today somewhat boring.’
</p><p>
‘Let me tell you about my last voyage that landed me in
this country,’ began the Sea Rat, ‘Family troubles, as usual,
began it. Icame on board a small trading boat from Constantinople
 to the Grecian Islands and the Levant. Those
were golden days and warm nights! In and out of port all
the time — old friends everywhere — sleeping in some cool
church during the heat of the day — parties after sundown,
under a velvet sky with great stars! From there we started
up the Adriatic and to Venice. O, Venice is a fine city, where
a rat can walk at his ease and take his pleasure!’
</p><p>
He was silent for a time; and the Water Rat was silent too.
</p><p>
‘Then we left for Palermo,’ continued the Sea Rat, ‘and
there I landed for a long, happy stay on shore. I never stay
too long on one ship. Besides, I love Sicily. I know everybody
there. I spent many happy weeks in the island. When I grew
restless again Itook a ship to Sardinia and Corsica. From
Corsica, by easy trips, and partly on foot, partly by sea, I got
to Marseilles. Sometimesl dream of the shell-fish of Marseilles, and wake up crying!’
</p><p>
‘By the way,’ said the polite Water Rat; ‘I believe you’re
hungry. Of course, you will stop and take your midday meal
with me? My hole is close by.’
</p><p>
‘That’s very kind of you,’ said the Sea Rat. ‘I am indeed
hungry. But could you bring it along out here? I am not too
fond of going underground; and then, while we eat, I could
tell you more about my voyages. Indoors I will at once fall
asleep.’
</p><p>
The Water Rat hurried off home. There he got out the
lunch-basket and packed a simple meal, in which he took
care to put a yard long French bread, a sausage, some cheese,
and a long-necked bottle. Together they unpacked the basket and laid out the food on the grass by the roadside.
</p><p>
The Sea Rat, as soon as he finished eating, continued the
history of his latest voyage. With excitement, the Water Rat 
followed him over stormy seas, across port bars, up rivers;
and left him at his dull farm.
</p><p>
The quiet world outside disappeared. And the talk, the
wonderful talk went on — and with beating heart he was
following the adventures of seaports, the fights, the escapes;
or he looked for treasure on islands, fished in lagoons and
slept day-long on warm white sand.
</p><p>
‘And now,’ the Sea Rat continued, ‘I take to the road
again, for many long and dusty days; till at last I reach the
little grey sea town I know so well. There, sooner or later,
the ships of all seafaring nations arrive. I will choose a ship
and run on board, and the voyage will begin!
</p><p>
‘And you will come too, young brother; for the days pass,
and never come back, and the South still waits for you. Take
the Adventure, hear the call! I will walk, and look back; and
at last I will see you coming!’
</p><p>
The words grew quieter and quieter; and the Water Rat
saw at last a distant spot on the road.
</p><p>
Mechanically he rose and repacked the lunch-basket,
carefully and slowly. Mechanically he came back home, and
packed his special treasures, carefully selected a strong
walking-stick, and with no hurry, but with no doubt at all, he
stepped out of his house as the Mole appeared at the door.
</p><p>
‘Where are you going, Ratty?’ asked the Mole in great
surprise, catching him by the arm.
</p><p>
‘Going South, with the rest of them,’ said the Rat dreamily, not looking at him.
</p><p>
It alarmed the Mole. He looked into his eyes and saw
that they were glassy — not his friend’s eyes, but the eyes of
some other animal! He pulled him inside, threw him down,
and held him.
</p><p>
The Rat fought for a while, and then his strength seemed
suddenly to leave him, and he lay still, with closed eyes, trembling. The Mole helped him to rise and placed him in a chair.
Mole closed the door, threw the Rat’s pack into a drawer, and
sat down quietly on the table by his friend, waiting for the
strange illness to pass. After some time the Rat fell asleep.
</p><p>
The Mole left him for a time and busied himself with
household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the room and found the Rat awake but apathetic,
silent, and depressed. But his eyes were his own eyes once
again. The Mole sat down and tried to cheer him up and
help him to tell his story.
</p><p>
Poor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but
how could he put into cold words what was an idea? It is not
surprising, then, that he couldn’t explain it to the Mole.
</p><p>
The Mole understood that his friend was out of danger.
But he had no interest in the matters of his daily life.
</p><p>
The Mole began to talk about the harvest, and the large
moon rising over fields. He talked of the reddening apples
around, of the browning nuts; he reached midwinter, its joys
and its cozy home life, and then he became simply lyrical.
</p><p>
By degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull
eyes brightened.
</p><p>
Then the tactful Mole went away and returned with a
pencil and a few sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his friend’s elbow.
</p><p>
‘It’s quite a long time since you did any poetry,’ he said.
‘Why don’t you try it this evening, instead of — well, thinking
over things so much?’
</p><p>
When the Mole secretly looked in again some time later, he
was happy to see that the Rat was busily writing something.
</p>
</div> 

 
<h3><span>CHAPTER X</span> The Further Adventures of Toad</h3>
<div>

<p>
The Toad woke up early. Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes 
first and his cold toes next; then he remembered
everything — his escape, his ﬂight, his guards; remembered, the first and best thing of all, that he was free!
</p><p>
Free! He was warm from end to end as he thought ofthe
happy world outside, waiting for him to make his triumphal
entrance. He shook himself and marched into the comfortable morning sun, cold but sure, hungry but hopeful. The
practical Toad was looking for something that could talk,
and tell him clearly which way to go.
</p><p>
The road ran side by side with a canal. ‘Well!’ said Toad to
himself. ‘One thing’s clear. They must both be coming FROM
somewhere, and going TO somewhere.’ So he marched by
the water’s edge.
</p><p>
Round a bend in the canal came a horse. There was a
long line attached to its collar, the further part of it 
throwing drops ofwater. Toad let the horse pass, and stood waiting.
</p><p>
With a pleasant sound of quiet water there appeared a
barge. On the barge there was a big stout woman wearing
a big sun-hat.
</p><p>
‘A nice morning, ma’am!’ she said to Toad.
</p><p>
‘It is, ma’am!’ answered Toad politely. ‘It IS a nice morning for those who are not in trouble. ButI am. My married 
daughter sent me a letter, she wanted me to come, so I set
off, not knowing what was wrong, but fearing the worst, as
you will understand, ma’am, ifyou’re a mother, too. I left my
business to look after itself — I’m in the washing line, you
see — and I left my young children to look after themselves,
and Ilost all my money, and lost my way, and I don’t like
to think what may be happening to my married daughter,
ma’am!’
</p><p>
‘Where does your married daughter live, ma’am?’ asked
the barge-woman.
</p><p>
‘She lives near the river, ma’am,’ said Toad. ‘Close to Toad
Hall. That’s a fine house somewhere in these parts.’
</p><p>
‘Toad Hall? Why, I’m going that way myself,’ answered
the barge-woman. ‘This canal joins the river a little above
Toad Hall; and then it’s an easy walk. I’ll give you a lift.’
</p><p>
She led the barge close to the bank, and Toad, with many
thanks, stepped lightly on board and sat down. ‘Toad’s luck
again!’ thought he.
</p><p>
‘So you’re in the washing line, ma’am?’ said the
barge-woman politely, as they went along. ‘It’s a very good
business. But surely you don’t DO all that work yourself,
ma’am?’
</p><p>
‘O, I have girls,’ said Toad lightly: ‘twenty girls, always at
work. But you know what GIRLS are, ma’am!’
</p><p>
‘So do I,’ said the barge-woman. ‘And are you very fond
of washing?’
</p><p>
‘I love it,’ said Toad. ‘A real pleasure, ma’am!’
</p><p>
‘What a bit of luck, meeting you!’ said the barge-woman,
thoughtfully.
</p><p>
‘What do you mean?’ asked Toad, nervously.
</p><p>
‘Well, look at me, now,’ replied the barge-woman. ‘I like
washing, too, just the same as you do; and do all my own 
washing. But my husband often leaves his work and the
barge to me. Now, instead of steering or looking after the
horse, he is hunting. He went off with the dog to get a rabbit for dinner. And how am I to do my washing?’
</p><p>
‘O, never mind about the washing,’ said Toad, not liking
the subject. ‘Try and fix your mind on that rabbit. A nice fat
young rabbit, I’m sure. Do you have any onions?’
</p><p>
‘I can’t fix my mind on anything but my washing,’ said
the barge-woman. ‘Why do you talk about rabbits, with
such a happy prospect before you? There are a lot of my
things in a corner of the cabin. Could you take one or
two ofthe most necessary sort and put them through the
wash-tub as we go along? It’ll be a pleasure to you, as you
rightly say, and a real help to me. You’ll find a tub, and
soap, and a kettle on the stove, and a bucket to take water from the canal with. Then I will know you’re enjoying
yourself, instead of sitting here, looking at the scenery.’
</p><p>
‘Let me steer!’ said Toad in panic, ‘and then you can
do your washing your own way. I might spoil your things,
or not do them as you like. I’m more used to gentlemen’s
things myself. It’s my special line.’
</p><p>
‘Let you steer?’ said the barge-woman, laughing. ‘It
takes some practice to steer a barge properly. Besides, it’s
dull work, and I want you to be happy. No, you will do the
washing you are so fond of, and I’ll do the steering that I un-
derstand.’
</p><p>
Toad looked for escape this way and that, saw that he
was too far from the bank for a ﬂying jump, and gave up. ‘I
think any fool can WASH!’ he thought.
</p><p>
He took the tub, soap and water, chose a few things, and
started.
</p><p>
A long half-hour passed. Toad was getting angrier and
angrier. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to
make them cleaner. Once or twice he looked nervously over
his shoulder at the barge-woman, but she was looking out
in front of her, busy in her steering. He was tired, and he
saw that his paws were beginning to look bad. He lost the
soap, for the fiftieth time.
</p><p>
A burst of laughter made him look round. The bargewoman was laughing, till the tears ran down her cheeks.
</p><p>
‘What fun!’ she said. ‘I thought you must be somebody
else all along, from the way you talked. Pretty washerwoman you are! Never washed in your life, I think!’
</p><p>
Toad lost all control of himself.
</p><p>
‘You ugly, low, FAT barge-woman!’ he cried; ‘how dare
you talk like that! Washerwoman indeed! Iam a Toad, a
very well-known, rich Toad! I will NOT let you laugh at me!’
</p><p>
The woman moved nearer to him and looked under his
hat closely. ‘Why, you’re a horrid, bad, ugly Toad!’ she cried.
‘And in my nice clean barge, too! That is a thing that I will
NOT have.’
</p><p>
One big arm shot out and caught Toad. Then the world
turned suddenly upside down, the barge seemed to ﬂy
lightly across the sky, and with the wind in his ears, Toad
found himself ﬂying through the air.
</p><p>
The water, when he eventually reached it with a loud
splash, was really cold. He rose to the surface, and the first
thing he saw was the fat barge-woman looking back at him
from the leaving barge and laughing.
</p><p>
He swam out for the shore, but the cotton dress made it
hard, and when he finally touched land he found it hard to
climb up the high bank. He took a short rest; then, gathering
his wet skirts well over his arms, he started to run after the 
barge as fast as his legs could carry him, angry, ready for
revenge.
</p><p>
The barge-woman was still laughing when he caught
up with her. Great revenge was what he wanted. Running
quickly on he took the horse, untied the rope, jumped lightly on the horse’s back, and galloped it for the open country.
Once he looked back, and saw the barge aground on the
other side of the canal, and the barge-woman gesticulating
wildly and crying, ‘Stop, stop, stop!’
</p><p>
The barge-horse was not strong, and its gallop soon
turned into an easy walk; but Toad was quite happy with
this, knowing that he was moving, and the barge was not.
</p><p>
He travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he
was feeling sleepy in the hot sunshine, when the horse
stopped, lowered his head, and began to eat the grass;
and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off.
He looked about him and found near him a dirty gip-
sy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on a bucket
turned upside down. A fire of sticks was burning nearby,
and over the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot
came smells — warm, rich smells. And Toad was real-
ly hungry. He looked the gipsy over carefully. So there
he sat, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and
smoked, and looked at him.
</p><p>
The gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and said, ‘Do
you want to sell that horse?’
</p><p>
The gipsy’s words seemed to show the way towards the
two things Toad wanted so badly — money and breakfast.
</p><p>
‘What?’ he said, ‘to sell this beautiful young horse? O,
no; it’s out ofthe question. Who’s going to take the washing
home to my customers every week? Besides, I’m too fond of 
him, and he simply loves me. All the same, how much might
you give me for this beautiful young horse?’
</p><p>
The gipsy looked the horse over, and then he looked Toad
over with equal care, and looked at the horse again. ‘Shilling
a leg,’ he said shortly, and turned away, continuing to smoke.
</p><p>
‘A shilling a leg?’ cried Toad. ‘I must take a little time to
work that out, and see just what it comes to.’
</p><p>
He climbed down off his horse, and sat down by the gipsy, and did sums on his fingers, and at last he said, ‘A shilling
a leg? That comes to exactly four shillings, and no more. O,
no; I could not think of getting four shillings for this beautiful young horse.’
</p><p>
‘Well,’ said the gipsy, ‘I’ll make it five shillings, and that’s
my last word.’
</p><p>
Then Toad sat and thought long and deeply. He was hungry
and quite penniless, and still some way — he did not know
how far — from home, and enemies might still be looking for
him. To one in such a situation, five shillings may very well
seem a large sum of money. But it did not seem very much to
get for a horse. At last he said firmly, ‘Look here, gipsy! I tell you
what we will do; and this is MY last word. You will give me six
shillings and sixpence; and you will give me as much breakfast
as I can eat, out of that iron pot that is sending such tasty and
exciting smells. In return, I will give you my beautiful young
horse. Or else I know a man who really wants to buy him.’
</p><p>
It was a long discussion. But in the end the gipsy gave him
six shillings and sixpence. Then he disappeared into the caravan for a moment, and returned with a large iron plate and
a knife, fork, and spoon. He put hot rich stew into the plate.
Toad took the plate on his lap, almost crying, and ate, and ate,
and ate. He thought it was the best breakfast in his life.
</p><p>
Then Toad got up and said good-bye to the gipsy and to
the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the riverside well, gave
him directions which way to go, and he happily set off again.
The sun was shining brightly, his wet clothes were quite
dry again, he had money in his pocket once more, he was
nearing home and friends and safety, and, most and best of
all, he was quite full, and strong, and careless.
</p><p>
‘Ho, ho!’ he said to himself as he marched along with
his chin in the air, ‘what a clever Toad I am! There is surely
no animal equal to me for cleverness in the whole world!
My enemies shut me up in prison, watched night and day;
Iwalk out through them all, by courage. They follow me
with engines, and policemen, and revolvers; I disappear,
laughing. I meet a woman who throws me into a canal. What
of it? I swim ashore, I take her horse, I ride off in triumph,
and I sell the horse for a whole pocketful of money and an
excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am The Toad, the handsome,
the popular, the successful Toad!’ He made up a song about
himself, and sang it at the top of his voice.
</p><p>
After some miles of country fields he reached the high
road, and as he turned into it and looked along its white
length, he saw coming to him a dot that turned into something he knew so well.
</p><p>
‘Great!’ said the happy Toad. ‘I will stop them, my brothers of the wheel, and they will give me a lift, of course, and
it may even end in my driving up to Toad Hall in a car!’
</p><p>
He stepped out into the road to stop the car. Suddenly he
became very pale, his heart turned to water, his knees shook
under him, and he fell down. ‘It is the car I took out of the
yard of the Red Lion Hotel on that fatal day!’ he thought. ‘And
the people in it are the very same people! It’s all over now!
</p><p>
Chains and policemen again! Prison again! Dry bread and
water again! O, what a fool I was! Why did I want to go about
the country, singing songs, and stopping people in broad day
on the high road, instead of hiding till nightfall and slipping
home quietly by back ways! O unhappy Toad! O poor animal!’
</p><p>
The terrible car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last
he heard it stop near him. Two gentlemen got out and walked
round him, and one of them said, ‘O dear! Here is a poor old
washerwoman who fell in the road! Let us lift her into the car
and take her to the nearest village, where surely she has friends.’
</p><p>
They carefully lifted Toad into the car and continued
their way.
</p><p>
When Toad heard them talk in so kind a way, and knew
that they did not remember him, he opened first one eye
and then the other.
</p><p>
‘Look!’ said one of the gentlemen, ‘the fresh air is doing
her good. How do you feel now, ma’am?’
</p><p>
‘Thank you kindly, Sir,’ said Toad in a weak voice, ‘I’m
feeling much better!’
</p><p>
‘That’s right,’ said the gentleman. ‘Now keep quite still,
and, above all, don’t try to talk.’
</p><p>
‘I won’t,’ said Toad. ‘I was only thinking, fresh air full in
my face could do me good. Can I sit on the front seat there,
beside the driver?’
</p><p>
‘What a very sensible woman!’ said the gentleman. ‘Of
course you can.’ So they carefully helped Toad into the front
seat beside the driver.
</p><p>
Toad was quite happy again.
</p><p>
‘Please, Sir,’ he said to the driver, ‘could you let me try
and drive the car for a while? I was watching you carefully,
and it looks so easy and so interesting!’
</p><p>
The driver laughed so loudly that the gentleman asked,
‘What’s the matter?’ When he heard, he said, ‘Bravo, ma’am!
Let her have a try, and look after her. She won’t do any harm.’
</p><p>
Toad quickly got into the driver’s seat, took the steering-wheel, listened to the instructions, and set the car in
motion, but very slowly and carefully at first, for he decided
to be sensible.
</p><p>
The gentlemen behind clapped their hands and ap-
plauded, and Toad heard them saying, ‘How well she does
it, for the first time!’
</p><p>
Toad went a little faster; then faster still, and faster.
</p><p>
He heard the gentlemen call out, ‘Be careful, washerwoman!’ And this made him angry, and he began to lose
his head.
</p><p>
The driver tried to stop him, but he blocked him with
one elbow, and put on full speed. The rush of air in his
face, the sound of the engines, and the light jump of the
car beneath him poisoned his weak brain. ‘Washerwoman,
indeed!’ he shouted. ‘Ho! ho! I am the Toad, the car stealer,
the prison-breaker, the Toad who always escapes! Sit still,
and you will know what driving really is, for you are in the
hands of the bravest Toad!’
</p><p>
With a cry of horror the whole party rose and threw
themselves on him. ‘Hold him!’ they cried, ‘hold the Toad,
the wicked animal who stole our car! Bind him, chain him,
drag him to the nearest police-station!’
</p><p>
With a half-turn of the wheel the Toad sent the car crashing through the low hedge that ran along the roadside. One
mighty jump, and the wheels of the car were mixing up the
thick mud of a horse-pond.
</p><p>
Toad found himself ﬂying through the air. Then he land-
ed on his back in the soft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, 
he could just see the car in the pond; the gentlemen and the
driver were swimming helplessly in the water.
</p><p>
He got up fast, and set off running across country as
hard as he could, till he was breathless and tired, and settled
down into an easy walk. When he could think calmly, he began to laugh, and he laughed till he sat down under a hedge.
‘Ho, ho!’ he cried happily, ‘Toad again! Who stopped them?
Who managed to get on the front seat? Who made them see
him driving? Who landed them all in a horse-pond? Who
escaped, ﬂying through the air, leaving them in the mud?
Why, Toad, of course; clever Toad, great Toad, GOOD Toad!’
</p><p>
Then he burst into song again, — ‘O, how clever I am!
How clever, how clever, how very clev—’
</p><p>
A noise at a distance behind him made him turn his head
and look. O horror! About two fields off, a driver and two
large policemen were running towards him as hard as they
could go!
</p><p>
Poor Toad jumped to his feet and hurried away again,
his heart in his mouth. O, my!’ he said, ‘what a FOOL I am!
Shouting and singing songs again! O my! O my! O my!’
</p><p>
He looked back, and saw to his horror that they were
getting nearer. He was doing his best, but he was a fat
animal, and his legs were short. He could hear them close
behind him now. He ran on wildly, looking back over his
shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when suddenly the
earth turned under his feet, and, splash! he found himself in
deep water, quick water, water that was carrying him along;
and he knew that in his panic he ran straight into the river!
</p><p>
He tried to catch hold of the plants that grew along the
water’s edge, but the river was so strong that it tore them
out of his hands. Soon he saw that he was approaching a
big dark hole in the bank, just above his head, and as the 
river was carrying him past he reached up with one paw
and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and
with difficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at
last he could rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There
he stayed for some minutes, for he was quite tired.
</p><p>
As he looked before him into the dark hole, some bright
small thing shone, moving towards him. As it came nearer,
a face grew up around it, and it was a well-known face!
</p><p>
Brown and small.
</p><p>
Serious and round, with neat ears and silky hair.
</p><p>
It was the Water Rat!
</p>
</div>



<h3><span>CHAPTER XI</span> ‘Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears’</h3>
<div>




<p>
The Rat put out a neat little brown paw, took Toad 
firmly by the neck, and pulled; and the Toad came up 
slowly but surely over the edge of the hole, till at last 
he stood in the hall, with the water streaming off him, but 
quite happy, for now he found himself once more in the
house of a friend.
</p><p>
‘O, Ratty!’ he cried. ‘Let me tell you about my adventures! Such sufferings! Then such escapes! Oh, AM a
smart Toad!’
</p><p>
‘Toad,’ said the Water Rat, seriously and firmly, ‘go off
upstairs at once, and take off that old cotton dress, and
clean yourself, and put on some of my clothes, and try and 
come down looking like a gentleman if you CAN! Now, stop
arguing, and be off! I’ll have something to say to you later!’
</p><p>
Toad wanted to stop and argue, but he saw himself in
the looking-glass, and he changed his mind and went very
quickly upstairs. There he washed his face and changed his
clothes, and stood for a long time before the glass, looking at himself with pride and pleasure, and thinking, ‘How
could anyone really mistake me for a washerwoman?’
</p><p>
By the time he came down again lunch was on the ta-
ble, and Toad was very glad to see it. While they ate Toad
told the Rat all his adventures, speaking mostly of his own
cleverness. But the more he talked and boasted, the more
serious and silent the Rat became.
</p><p>
Then there was silence for a while; and then the Rat
said, ‘Now, Toady, I don’t want to hurt your feelings, after
all your experiences, but, seriously, where’s the fun in that?
What caused all this? Why, it was a car. Why did you steal
it? Why do you want to be a prisoner? When are you going
to be clever, and think of your friends? Do you think it’s any
pleasure to me to hear animals saying, as I go about, “There
are criminals among his friends"?’
</p><p>
Toad was a nice kind animal and never minded such
words from his real friends. And he was always able to see
the other side ofthe question. So, while the Rat was talking
so seriously, he kept saying to himself, ‘But it WAS fun!’ But
after the Rat’s speech he said, very sadly, ‘Quite right, Ratty!
How SERIOUS you always are! Yes, Iwas a fool, I can quite
see that; but now I’m going to be a good Toad. I’m not so
fond of cars after my drive into that river. We’ll have our
coffee, and a quiet chat, and then I’m going to walk quietly
down to Toad Hall, and put on my own clothes, and lead a 
quiet, respectable life, taking care of my property, and doing a little landscape gardening at times. There will always
be a bit of dinner for my friends when they come to see me;
and Iwill keep a pony to ride about the country, just as in
the good old days.’
</p><p>
‘Walk quietly down to Toad Hall?’ cried the Rat. ‘What
are you talking about? Do you mean to say you don’t KNOW?’
</p><p>
‘Know what?’ said the Toad, turning rather pale. ‘Go on,
Ratty! Quick! What is it?’
</p><p>
‘Do you mean to tell me,’ said the Rat, beating with his
little fist upon the table, ‘that you don’t know about the
Stoats and Weasels and how they live in Toad Hall?’
</p><p>
Toad put his elbows on the table, and his chin on his
paws; and a large tear came up in each of his eyes, and
dropped on the table.
</p><p>
‘Go on, Ratty,’ he said; ‘tell me all. The worst is over. I
can bear it.’
</p><p>
‘After your disappearance,’ said the Rat, slowly and impressively; ‘they talked about it a lot down here, naturally;
not only along the river-side, but even in the Wild Wood.
Animals took sides, as always happens. The river-bankers
were for you, but the Wild Wood animals said hard things,
and served you right, and went about saying, “That’s the
end of Toad! He will NEVER come back, never, never!”’
</p><p>
Toad nodded.
</p><p>
‘But Mole and Badger,’ the Rat went on, ‘they kept saying,
“No, Toad will come back again soon, somehow.”’ So they moved
their things to Toad Hall, and slept there, and had it all ready
for your return. They didn’t know what was going to happen,
of course; still, they didn’t trust the Wild Wood animals. Now
I come to the most tragic part of my story. One dark night — 
it was a VERY dark night, and blowing hard, too, and raining
heavily — a band of weasels carrying guns came silently up to
the front entrance. At the same time, a band of ferrets, coming
through the kitchen-garden, occupied the backyard; while a
company of stoats occupied the billiard-room, and held the
French windows opening onto the lawn.
</p><p>
‘The Mole and the Badger were sitting by the fire, telling
stories, when those bandits broke down the doors and rushed
in upon them from every side. They made the best fight they
could, but what was the good? What can two animals do
against hundreds? They took and beat them with sticks, those
two poor creatures, and threw them out into the cold and the
wet, with many bad words!’
</p><p>
Here the unfeeling Toad broke into a laugh, and then pulled
himself together and tried to look serious.
</p><p>
‘So the Wild Wooders are living in Toad Hall,’ continued
the Rat; ‘They are used to lying in bed half the day, and have
breakfast at all hours, and the place is in such a mess! They
are eating your food, and drinking your drinks, and making
bad jokes about you, and singing vulgar songs, about — well,
about prisons and policemen; horrid personal songs, with no
humor in them. And they’re telling everybody, “We’re going to
stay here for ever.”’
</p><p>
‘O, are they!’ said Toad getting up and taking a stick. ‘I’ll
soon see about that!’
</p><p>
‘It’s no good, Toad!’ called the Rat after him. ‘You’ll only
get into trouble.’
</p><p>
But the Toad was off. He marched quickly down the road,
his stick over his shoulder, speaking to himself in his anger,
till he got near his front gate, when suddenly there jumped
up from behind a bush a long yellow ferret with a gun.
</p><p>
‘Who comes there?’ said the ferret sharply.
</p><p>
‘Rubbish and nonsense!’ said Toad, very angrily. ‘What
do you mean by talking like that to me? Come out of that at
once, or I’ll—’
</p><p>
The ferret didn’t answer, but he brought his gun up to
his shoulder. Toad dropped flat in the road, and BANG! a
bullet went over his head.
</p><p>
The Toad got to his feet and ran off down the road as
hard as he could; and as he ran he heard the ferret laughing,
and other little laughs joining him.
</p><p>
He went back, very depressed, and told the Water Rat
about it.
</p><p>
‘That’s it,’ said the Rat. ‘It’s no good. They all have guns.
You must just wait.’
</p><p>
Still, Toad didn’t want to give up all at once. So he got
out the boat, and set off rowing up the river to where the
garden front of Toad Hall came down to the waterside.
There he rested on his oars and looked the land over. All
seemed very peaceful and quiet. He could see the whole
front of Toad Hall in the evening; the garden, the flowers;
the path that led up to the boat-house, the little wooden
bridge that crossed it; all waiting for his return. ‘I must try
the boat-house first,’ he thought. Very carefully he rowed,
and was just passing under the bridge, when a great stone
from above smashed through the bottom of the boat. It
filled and sank, and Toad found himself swimming in deep
water. Looking up, he saw two stoats looking over the parapet of the bridge and watching him merrily. ‘It will be
your head next time, Toady!’ they called out to him. The
angry Toad swam to shore, while the stoats laughed and
laughed.
</p><p>
The Toad came back on foot, and retold his sad experiences to the Water Rat once more.
</p><p>
‘Well, WHAT did I tell you?’ said the Rat hotly. ‘And
you lost my boat that I was so fond of, and simply ruined
the nice clothes that I gave you! Really, Toad, of all the
animals — I wonder how you manage to keep any friends
at all!’
</p><p>
Toad made a full apology to Rat for losing his boat and
spoiling his clothes. He finished by saying, with that face
which always disarmed his friend’s criticism and won them
back to his side, ‘Ratty! I see it was foolish. Believe me, I will
take no action without your kind advice!’
</p><p>
‘Then my advice to you is, because ofthe lateness ofthe
hour, to sit down and have your supper, which will be on
the table in a minute, and be very patient. I am sure that we
can do nothing until we see the Mole and the Badger, and
hear their latest news, and take their advice in this difficult
matter.’
</p><p>
‘Oh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger,’ said
Toad, lightly. ‘How are they?’
</p><p>
‘Well may you ask!’ said the Rat. ‘They keep camping out
in the open, in every sort of weather, watching over your
house, patrolling your gardens, watching the stoats and the
weasels, planning how to get your property back for you.
You don’t deserve to have such friends, Toad, you don’t, really. Some day you’ll be very sorry!’
</p><p>
‘I’m an ungrateful beast, I know,’ cried Toad with bitter
tears. ‘Let me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark
night, and share their difficulties, and try — Oh, supper’s
here at last, hooray! Come on, Ratty!’
</p><p>
Just after their meal there came a heavy knock at the door.
</p><p>
Toad was nervous, but the Rat, nodding mysteriously at
him, went straight up to the door and opened it, and let in
Mr. Badger.
</p><p>
He was looking very wild and tired. He came up to Toad,
shook him by the paw, and said, ‘Welcome home, Toad!
What am I saying? Home, indeed! This is a poor home-coming. Unhappy Toad!’ Then he sat down to the table, and took
a large piece of cold pie.
</p><p>
The Rat said to Toad, ‘Don’t say anything to him just yet.
He’s always rather depressed when he is hungry. In half an
hour’s time he’ll be quite a different animal.’
</p><p>
So they waited in silence, and then there came another
knock. The Rat went to the door and let in the Mole, with
bits of dry grass in his fur.
</p><p>
‘Hooray! Here’s old Toad!’ cried the Mole, smiling.
‘Great!’ And he began to dance round him. ‘You managed to
escape, you clever Toad!’
</p><p>
The Rat pulled him by the elbow; but it was too late.
Toad was growing proud already.
</p><p>
‘Clever? O, no!’ he said. ‘I’m not really clever, according
to my friends. I only broke out of the strongest prison in
England, that’s all! And caught a railway train and escaped
on it, that’s all! And went about the country in disguise,
that’s all! Oh, no! I’m a fool, I am! I’ll tell you one or two
of my little adventures, Mole, and you will judge for yourself!’
</p><p>
‘Well, well,’ said the Mole, moving towards the supper-
table; ‘let you talk while I eat. Not a bite since breakfast! O
my! O my!’ And he sat down to supper.
</p><p>
Toad sat down, put his paw into his pocket and pulled
out a handful of silver. ‘Look at that!’ he cried, displaying it.
</p><p>
‘That’s not so bad, is it, for a few minutes’ work? And how do
you think I did it, Mole? Horse-selling! That’s how I did it!’
</p><p>
‘Go on, Toad,’ said the Mole with great interest.
</p><p>
‘Toad, be quiet, please!’ said the Rat. ‘Never mind it,
Mole, but please tell us as soon as possible what the position is, and what’s best to do, now that Toad is back at last.’
</p><p>
‘The position’s about as bad as it can be,’ answered the
Mole sadly; ‘and as for what to do, I don’t know! There are
guards and weapons everywhere, and they threw stones at
us; always an animal keep watch, and when they see us,
they start laughing! That is the worst!’
</p><p>
‘It’s a very difficult situation,’ said the Rat, deep in
thought. ‘But I think I see now what Toad really must do. I
will tell you. He must—’
</p><p>
‘Oh no!’ cried the Mole, with his mouth full. ‘Nothing of the
sort! You don’t understand. What he must do is, he must—’
</p><p>
‘Well, I won’t do it, anyway!’ cried Toad in excitement.
‘I’m not going to listen to your orders! It’s my house we’re
talking about, and I know exactly what to do, and I’ll tell
you. I’m going to—’
</p><p>
By this time they were all three talking at once, at the
top of their voices, when a thin, dry voice said, ‘Be quiet, all
of you!’ and then everyone was silent.
</p><p>
It was the Badger, who was looking at them severely.
Then he turned back to the table and reached out for the
cheese. And the others kept silence till the end of his meal.
Then the Badger got up from his seat and stood before the
fireplace, deep in thought. At last he spoke.
</p><p>
‘Toad!’ he said severely. ‘You bad, troublesome little animal!
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, you, a son of my good friend?’
</p><p>
Toad burst out crying.
</p><p>
‘There, there!’ went on the Badger, more kindly. ‘Never
mind. Stop crying. We’re going to forget everything, and try
and turn over a new leaf. But what the Mole says is quite true.
The stoats are on guard, at every point, and they are the best
guards in the world. It’s quite useless to think of attacking the
place. They’re too strong for us.’
</p><p>
‘Then it’s all over,’ said the Toad, crying into the sofa. ‘I will
go and become a soldier, and never see my dear Toad Hall
again!’
</p><p>
‘Cheer up, Toady!’ said the Badger. ‘There are more ways
of getting back a place than attacking it. Now I’m going to tell
you a great secret.’
</p><p>
Toad sat up slowly and dried his eyes. He loved secrets
very much, because he never could keep one, and he enjoyed
sharing them.
</p><p>
‘There — is — an — underground — passage,’ said the
Badger, impressively, ‘that leads from the river-bank right up
into the middle of Toad Hall.’
</p><p>
‘Oh, nonsense, Badger,’ said Toad. ‘I know every inch of
Toad Hall, inside and out. There is nothing of the sort!’
</p><p>
‘My young friend,’ said the Badger, with great severity,
‘your father, who was a great animal — a lot better than some
others I know — was my special friend. He discovered that
passage — he didn’t make it, of course — and he repaired it
and cleaned it out; and he showed it to me. “Don’t let my son
know about it,” he said. “He’s a good boy, but very light in character, and simply cannot hold his tongue. Don’t tell him about
it till he really needs it.”’
</p><p>
‘Well, well,’ Toad said; ‘of course I talk a lot. A popular fellow such as I am — my friends get round me — we chatter,
we tell funny stories — and somehow my tongue gets too 
free. Never mind. Go on, Badger. How’s this passage going to
help us?’
</p><p>
‘I found out that there’s going to be a big banquet tomorrow night,’ continued the Badger. ‘It’s somebody’s
birthday — the Chief Weasel’s, I think — and all the weasels will be together in the dining-hall, eating and having
fun. No guns, no sticks, no arms of any sort!’
</p><p>
‘But the guards will keep watch as usual,’ said the Rat.
</p><p>
‘Exactly,’ said the Badger; ‘And that is where the passage
comes in. It leads right up under the cupboard, next to the dining-hall!’
</p><p>
‘Aha! that old board!’ said Toad. ‘Now I understand it!’
</p><p>
‘We will come out quietly—’ cried the Mole.
</p><p>
‘—with our pistols and sticks—’ said the Rat.
</p><p>
‘—and rush in upon them,’ said the Badger.
</p><p>
‘—and beat them, and beat them, and beat them!’ cried the
Toad in ecstasy, running round and round the room, and jumping over the chairs.
</p><p>
‘Very well, then,’ said the Badger, with his usual dry manner
, ‘now go to bed. We will make all the necessary arrangements in the course of the morning tomorrow.’
</p><p>
Toad slept till a late hour next morning. He found the
Badger in the armchair, reading the paper, and not thinking
the least about what was going to happen that very evening.
The Rat was running round the room busily, with his arms
full of weapons of every kind, putting them in four little piles
on the ﬂoor, and saying excitedly, ‘Here’s-a-stick-for-the-Rat,
here’s-a-stick—for-the Mole, here’s-a-stick-for-the-Toad, here’s-
a-stick—for-the-Badger! Here’s-a-pistol-for-the-Rat, here’s-a-
pistol-for-the-Mole, here’s-a-pistol-for-the-Toad, here’s-a-pis-
tol-for-the-Badger!’ and so on.
</p><p>
‘That’s all very well, Rat,’ said the Badger, looking at the
busy little animal over the edge of his newspaper; ‘But just
let us once get past the stoats, with their ugly guns, and we
won’t need any sticks or pistols. We four, with our sticks,
once we’re inside the dining-hall, will clear the ﬂoor of all
of them in five minutes.’
</p><p>
‘Better be on the safe side,’ said the Rat, polishing a pistol.
</p><p>
Then the Mole came into the room. ‘I had such fun!’ he
began at once; ‘I frightened the stoats!’
</p><p>
‘I hope you were very careful, Mole,’ said the Rat ner-
vously.
</p><p>
‘I hope so, too,’ said the Mole. ‘I found that Toad’s washerwoman dress hanging before the fire. So I put it on, and
the hat, and the shawl, and went off to Toad Hall. The guards
were there, of course, with their guns and their “Who comes
there?” and all the rest of their nonsense. “Good morning,
gentlemen!” said I, very respectfully. “Do you want any
washing today?”
</p><p>
‘They said, “Go away, washerwoman! We don’t do any
washing on duty.”
</p><p>
“‘Or any other time?” said. Ho, ho, ho! Wasn’t I FUNNY,
Toad?’
</p><p>
‘Careless animal!’ said Toad, very hotly. He felt very jealous of Mole’s act.
</p><p>
‘Some of the stoats turned quite pink,’ continued the
Mole, ‘and the Sergeant, he said to me, “Now run away, my
good woman, run away! Don’t keep my men talking on their
posts.” “Run away?” said I; “it won’t be me that’ll be running
away, in a very short time!”’
</p><p>
‘O MOLY, how could you?’ said the Rat in alarm.
</p><p>
The Badger laid down his paper.
</p><p>
‘I could see them pricking up their ears and looking
at each other,’ went on the Mole; ‘and the Sergeant said
to them, "Never mind HER; she doesn’t know what she’s
talking about."’
</p><p>
“‘O! don’t I?"’ said. “Well, let me tell you this. My daughter,
she washes for Mr. Badger, so I know what I’m talking about;
and YOU’LL know pretty soon, too! A hundred angry badgers
with guns are going to attack Toad Hall this very night. Rats
with pistols will come up the river and land in the garden;
and a group of dangerous Toads will attack the house!" Then I
ran away, and I hid; and then I came secretly back and looked
at them through the hedge. They were all as nervous as they
could be, running all ways at once, and falling over each other,
and every one giving orders to everybody else and not listen-
ing; and the Sergeant kept sending off parties of stoats to distant parts of the grounds, and then sending other fellows to
take them back again; and I heard them saying to each other,
”That’s just like the weasels; they’re to have fun, and food, and
toasts, and songs, while we must keep watch in the cold and
the dark, and meet angry Badgersl’"
</p><p>
‘Oh, you fool, Mole!’ cried Toad, ‘You spoilt everything!’
</p><p>
‘Mole,’ said the Badger, in his dry, quiet way, ‘I must say
you have more brains in your little finger than some other
animals have in the whole of their fat bodies. Good Mole!
Clever Mole!’
</p><p>
The Toad was simply wild with jealousy. He couldn’t un-
derstand what the Mole did that was so very clever. Fortunately for him, the bell rang for lunch.
</p><p>
It was a simple meal, after which the Badger fell asleep,
and the nervous Rat continued his preparations, and started running between his four little piles. And the Mole took 
Toad by his arm, led him out into the open air, sat him into
</p><p>
a chair, and made him tell him all his adventures from beginning to end, which Toad was only too glad to do.
</p>

<h3><span>CHAPTER XII</span> The Return of Ulysses</h3>
<div>



<p>
When it began to grow dark, the Rat, with excitement
 and mystery, gathered them into the room, 
 stood each of them in front of his little pile, and
tried to dress them up for the coming expedition. He was
very serious about it, and it took quite a long time.
</p><p>
When all was quite ready, the Badger took a dark lamp
in one paw, his great stick in the other, and said, ‘Now then,
follow me! Mole first; Rat next; Toad last. And look here,
Toady! Don’t you chatter so much as usual, or you’ll go back!’
</p><p>
The Badger led them along by the river for a little way,
and then suddenly jumped into a hole in the river-bank, a
little above the water. The Mole and the Rat followed silently, but when it came to Toad’s turn, of course he managed to
slip and fall into the water with a loud splash and a cry of
alarm. His friends caught him, rubbed him down and comforted him; but the Badger was really angry.
</p><p>
So at last they were in the secret passage, and the expedition really began!
</p><p>
It was cold, and dark, and wet, and low, and narrow, and
poor Toad began to shake, partly from horror, partly because he was wet through. The lamp was far ahead, and
he kept behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the
Rat call out, ‘COME on, Toad!’ and he ‘came on’ with such a
rush that he upset the Rat into the Mole and the Mole into
the Badger, and for a moment all was confusion. The Badger thought somebody attacked them from behind, and, as
there was no space to use a stick, drew a pistol, and was
ready to put a bullet into Toad. When he found out the cause
of the confusion he was very angry indeed, and said, ‘Now
this time that tiresome Toad WILL stay behind!’
</p><p>
But Toad cried, and the other two promised to look after him, and at last the Badger agreed, and the procession
moved on; only this time the Rat was the last, with a strong
hand on the Toad’s shoulder.
</p><p>
So they went along, with their ears up and their paws
on their pistols. Then suddenly they heard, far away and
yet nearly over their heads, a mixed murmur of sound, as if
people were cheering and stamping on the ﬂoor and beating on tables. The Badger said, ‘They ARE having a banquet!’
</p><p>
The passage now began to go up; and then the noise broke
out again, quite distinct this time, and very close above them.
They hurried along the passage till they found themselves
standing under the door that led up into the servants’ room.
</p><p>
Such a great noise was going on in the banqueting-hall
that nobody could hear them. The Badger said, ‘Now, boys,
all together!’ and the four of them put their shoulders to
the door and opened it. They found themselves standing
in a small room, with only a door between them and the
banqueting-hall.
</p><p>
The noise, as they entered from the passage, was great. At
last, as the cheering and beating slowly became lower, a voice
said, ‘Well, I do not want to speak much longer’ — (great
applause) — ‘but before I take my seat’ — (new cheering) —
‘I’d like to say one word about our kind host, Mr. Toad. We all
know Toad!’ — (great laughter) — ‘GOOD Toad, KIND Toad,
HONEST Toad!’ (laughter).
</p><p>
‘Only just let me get at him!’ said Toad.
</p><p>
‘Get ready, all of you!’ said the Badger.
</p><p>
‘—Let me sing you a little song,’ went on the voice, ‘which
I composed on the subject of Toad’—(long applause).
</p><p>
When the ChiefWeasel — for it was he — began singing,
the Badger took his stick with both paws, looked round at
his friends, and cried—
</p><p>
‘It’s time! Follow me!’
</p><p>
And opened the door wide.
</p><p>
What a noise and cries filled the air!
</p><p>
How the weasels dived under the tables and jumped
madly up at the windows! How the ferrets ran wildly for
the fireplace to hide in the chimney! How tables and chairs
were upset, in the panic of that terrible moment when the
four Heroes ran into the room! The mighty Badger, his great
stick flying through the air; Mole, black and severe, with his
terrible war-cry, ‘A Mole! A Mole!’ Rat, brave and confident,
with weapons of every sort at his belt; Toad, jumping into
the air! There were only four of them, but to the terrified
weasels the hall seemed full of monstrous animals, grey,
black, brown and yellow, jumping with enormous sticks;
and they ﬂed in terror, this way and that, through the windows, up the chimney, anywhere to get from those terrible
sticks.
</p><p>
It was all over in five minutes. Through the broken windows came the cries of terrified weasels escaping across
the lawn; on the ﬂoor lay some dozen or so of the enemy,
on whom the Mole was busily fitting handcuffs. The Badger
was resting from his labors.
</p><p>
‘Mole,’ he said, ‘you’re the best of fellows! Just come outside and look after those stoat-guards, and see what they’re
doing. I think that, thanks to you, we won’t have much trouble from them tonight!’
</p><p>
The Mole went through a window; and the Badger asked
the others, ‘Could you two set a table on its legs again, pick
up knives and forks and plates and glasses from the floor,
and look for some food?’ They were ready to sit down to
supper when the Mole came in through the window, laughing, with an armful of riﬂes.
</p><p>
‘It’s all over,’ he said. ‘As soon as the stoats heard the
cries and the noise inside the hall, some of them threw
down their riﬂes and ran away. The others stood for a bit,
but when the weasels came rushing out upon them and the
stoats mixed with the weasels, they all disappeared. Here
are their rifles.’
</p><p>
‘Excellent animal!’ said the Badger, his mouth full of
chicken. ‘Now, there’s just one more thing Iwant you to
do, Mole, before you sit down to your supper with us; and
I don’t want to trouble you only Iknow you will do it all
right. Iwant you to take those fellows on the ﬂoor there
upstairs with you, and make them clean the bedrooms and
tidy up. See that they wash UNDER the beds, and put clean
sheets and pillow-cases on, and have a can of hot water,
and clean towels, and soap in each room. And then you can
give them a beating, if you like, and put them out by the 
back-door, and we won’t see any more of THEM, Ithink.
And then come along and have some of this cold tongue.
It’s first class.’
</p><p>
The Mole picked up a stick, formed his prisoners up in
a line on the ﬂoor, gave them the order ‘Quick march!’ and
led them off to the upper ﬂoor. After a time, he appeared
again, smiling, and said, ‘The rooms are clean and ready!
And I didn’t beat them. They had enough for one night, and
the weasels quite agreed with me. They said, “We’re very
sorry. It was all because of the Chief Weasel and the stoats.
We’re happy to be of any service to you.” So I gave them a
roll apiece, and let them out at the back, and off they ran, as
hard as they could!’
</p><p>
Then the Mole pulled his chair up to the table, and ate the
cold tongue; and Toad put all his jealousy from him, and said
heartily, ‘Thank you kindly, dear Mole, for all your trouble
tonight, and especially for your cleverness this morning!’ The
Badger liked that, and said, ‘There spoke my brave Toad!’ So
they finished their supper in great joy and peace, and then
went to rest between clean sheets, safe in Toad’s home.
</p><p>
The following morning, the Badger said to Toad: ‘I’m
sorry, Toad, but I’m afraid there’s a heavy morning’s work
in front of you. You see, we really must have a Banquet at
once, to celebrate the victory. It’s the rule.’
</p><p>
‘O, all right!’ said the Toad, readily. ‘Anything you want.
But why do you want to have a Banquet in the morning?’
</p><p>
‘Don’t try to look stupider than you really are,’ replied
the Badger; ‘The Banquet will be at night, ofcourse, but you
must write and send the invitations at once. Now, sit down
at that table — there’s letter-paper on it, with “Toad Hall” at 
the top in blue and gold — and write invitations to all our
friends. And I’LL order the Banquet.’
</p><p>
The Badger left the room in the direction of the kitchen,
and as soon as the door closed behind him, Toad hurried to the
writing-table. A fine idea came to him. He WILL write the invitations; and he will take care to tell about the leading part he
took in the fight, and how he knocked down the Chief Weasel;
and he will speak of his adventures. It will be like this —
</p><p>
SPEECH. . . . BY TOAD.
</p><p>
(There will be other speeches by TOAD during the evening.)
</p><p>
ADDRESS. . . BY TOAD
</p><p>
SYNOPSIS — Our Prison System — the Waterways of
Old England — Horse-selling, and how to sell — Property,
its rights and its duties — Back to the Land — A Typical
English Squire.
</p><p>
SONG. . . . BY TOAD. (Author: Toad.) OTHER COMPOSITIONS. BY TOAD
</p><p>
The idea pleased him very much, and he worked very
hard and wrote all the letters by noon. One of the weasels
was to deliver them. When the other animals came back
to lunch, very fresh after a morning on the river, the Mole
looked at Toad, expecting to find him depressed. Instead,
he was so happy that the Mole grew nervous; while the Rat
and the Badger exchanged looks.
</p><p>
As soon as the meal was over, Toad put his paws deep
into his trouser-pockets, and said, ‘Well, look after yourselves, you fellows! Ask for anything you want!’ and was
going off in the direction of the garden, where he wanted to
think out an idea or two for his coming speeches, when the
Rat caught him by the arm.
</p><p>
Toad did his best to get away; but when the Badger took
him firmly by the other arm he began to see that the game
was up. The two animals put him into a chair. Then they
both stood in front of him, while Toad sat silent and looked
at them darkly.
</p><p>
‘Now, look here, Toad,’ said the Rat. ‘We want you to understand clearly, once and for all, that there are going to be
no speeches and no songs. Try and understand the fact that
this time we’re not arguing with you; we’re just telling you.’
</p><p>
Toad saw that they saw through him.
</p><p>
‘May I sing them just one LITTLE song?’ he asked.
</p><p>
‘No, not ONE little song,’ answered the Rat firmly, though
his heart hurt as he noticed the trembling lip of the poor
Toad. ‘It’s no good, Toady; you know well that your songs
are all too proud and self-important; and your speeches are
all self-praise and — and — well, and not true and — and—’
</p><p>
‘And rubbish,’ put in the Badger, in his common way.
</p><p>
‘It’s all for your own good, Toady,’ went on the Rat. ‘You
know you MUST turn over a new leaf sooner or later, and
now seems a splendid time to begin; a sort ofturning-point
in your career. Please don’t think that saying all this doesn’t
hurt me more than it hurts you.’
</p><p>
Toad stood a long while in thought. At last he raised his
head, and the strong emotions were on his face. ‘You win, my
friends,’ he said. ‘You are right, Iknow, and am wrong. So
now I will be a very different Toad. My friends, you will never
blush for me again. But, O dear, O dear, this is a hard world!’
</p><p>
And, pressing his handkerchief to his face, he left the
room, with shaking footsteps.
</p><p>
‘Badger,’ said the Rat, ‘I feel like a monster; I wonder
what YOU feel like?’
</p><p>
‘O, I know, I know,’ said the Badger sadly. ‘But we must do
it. This good fellow will live here, and have respect. Would
you like him to be a common laughing-stock, for stoats and
weasels?’
</p><p>
‘Of course not,’ said the Rat. ‘And, talking of weasels, it’s
lucky we came upon that little weasel, just as he was setting
out with Toad’s invitations. They were simply ugly. I con-
fiscated them, and the good Mole is now writing the new
ones’
</p><p>
At last the hour for the banquet began to draw near,
and Toad was still sitting in his bedroom. Gradually his face
cleared, and he began to smile. Then he took to laughing in
a quiet manner. At last he got up, locked the door, drew the
curtains across the windows, collected all the chairs in the
room and arranged them around, and took up his position
in front ofthem. Then he bowed, and, letting himself go, he
sang his last little song to the audience that his imagination
so clearly saw.
</p><p>
Then he went quietly down the stairs to greet his guests.
</p><p>
All the animals cheered when he entered, and crowd-
ed round to congratulate him and say nice things about his
courage, and his cleverness, and his fighting qualities; but
Toad only smiled weakly, and said, ‘Not at all!’ Otter, who
was describing to a circle of friends exactly how he could
manage things, came forward, threw his arm round Toad’s
neck, and tried to take him round the room in triumphal
progress; but Toad said gently, as he set free, ‘The plan was
Badger’s; the Mole and the Water Rat did the fighting; I did
little or nothing.’ The animals looked at him in surprise; and
Toad felt, as he moved from one guest to the other, that he
was an object of absorbing interest to everyone.
</p><p>
The banquet was a great success. There was much talking and laughter among the animals; and there were some
cries of ‘Toad! Speech! Speech from Toad! Song! Mr. Toad’s
song!’ But Toad only shook his head gently, and raised one
paw in protest.
</p><p>
He was indeed a different Toad!
</p><p>
After this adventure, the four animals continued to lead
their lives. Toad bought a handsome gold chain and medallion with pearls, which he sent to the guards daughter with a
letter that even the Badger liked; and the engine-driver, in his
turn, got thanks and compensation for all his trouble. Under
severe press from the Badger, even the barge-woman, with
some trouble, got the money for her horse.
</p><p>
Sometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the
friends took a walk together in the Wild Wood; and it was
pleasing to see how respectfully the animals greeted them,
and how the mother-weasels brought their young ones to
the entrance of their holes, and said, ‘Look, baby! There
goes the great Mr. Toad! And that’s the brave Water Rat, a
terrible fighter, walking along with him! And there comes
the famous Mr. Mole!’ But when their infants were beyond
control, they quietened them by telling how the terrible
grey Badger will get them. This was a lie, because Badger,
though he cared little about Society, was very fond of chil-
dren; but it always had its full effect.

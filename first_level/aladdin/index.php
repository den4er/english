<h2>"THE STORY OF ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP"</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1.</h3>

<div>

<p>
Once upon a time there lived a poor tailor.
He had a son Aladdin. This boy was very idle;
he wanted to do nothing but play all day long.</p><p>
Soon his father fell sick and died.</p><p>
One day Aladdin was sitting in the street
and playing with his friends, a stranger came
along. The stranger was a magician. And he 
asked Aladdin, “Boy, are you not the son of
the tailor?”</p><p>
Aladdin answered, “Yes, O my master, but
my father is dead.”</p><p>
The magician began to weep. Aladdin asked
the stranger, “Did you know my father?”
The stranger replied, “My boy, your father
was my brother! And now he is dead. O my
son, where is your house, and where is your
mother?”</p><p>
Aladdin showed him the way to their house,
and the sorcerer gave him some coins, “Take
this money, give it to your mother and tell her
that your uncle came.”</p><p>
When the uncle saw the poor woman, he said,
“I am your husband’s brother. Forty years ago I
left this city and travelled around the world. I
visited India and China, and Arabia, and Egypt.
I studied magic there.”</p><p>
The woman answered, “Indeed, my husband
had a brother. But I always thought he was
dead.”</p><p>
“No, that’s not true, I’m alive! Please tell
me about this boy.”</p><p>
“This is my son, and he is very lazy. He
doesn’t like to work; he wants to play all day
long.”</p><p>
“That’s a pity,” said the magician. “But tomorrow
I will show him something useful.”</p><p>
The next day the magician took Aladdin to
the market and bought him a new dress. Then
he led Aladdin from garden to garden till they
came to a hill. Aladdin asked his uncle, “My
uncle, where do we go? We came to the mountain.
There are no more gardens ahead, so let
us turn and go back to the city.”</p><p>
But his uncle replied, “No, my son. This is
the road, and it is not an end of the gardens.”
At last they came to two mountains. The
stranger said, “Gather up thin dry sticks to
make a fire.”</p><p>
Aladdin collected small dry sticks. His uncle
burnt an incense and said mysterious words. 
Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician
caught him and gave him a blow.</p><p>
The poor boy asked, “Why do you beat me?”
His uncle answered, “My son, obey me, and
shortly you will forget all your troubles.”
Suddenly the earth opened. There appeared a
square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle.
The wizard said to Aladdin, “If you do what
I tell you, you will become richer than all the
kings put together. There is buried here a
treasure which is deposited in your name. No
one else may touch it. Put your hand to the
ring and raise the stone, only you have the
power to open it. This treasure is immense. It
is all for you and for me.”</p><p>
So poor Aladdin said, “O my uncle, command
me and I will obey you.”</p><p>
And the wizard said to him, “You are like
my own child! Go to that ring and lift it.
And repeat your name and the names of your father
and mother.”</p><p>
So Aladdin said the names of his parents and
lifted the stone. Before him lay twelve steps.
The wizard said to him, “Aladdin, descend
carefully there. You will find a place divided into
three large halls. In each hall you will see four
golden jars. Don’t touch anything, or you will
die. Leave them and go on to the fourth hall.
You will find a door. Open the door, enter, and
you will see a garden full of fruit trees. Then
you will see a ladder of about fifty steps. Come
to a niche in a terrace. There stands a lighted
lamp. Bring it to me.”</p><p>
He gave a ring to Aladdin, and said, “My
son, this ring will guard you. You will become
the richest man in the world!”</p><p>
So Aladdin went down into the cave. He
found the halls and the golden jars. Then he
came to the garden and went through it till he 
found the ladder. He climbed the ladder, took
the Lamp, and went down into the garden.</p><p>
The trees were all covered with precious stones
instead of fruit. Each tree was of a different
kind and had different jewels, of all colours,
green and white and yellow and red and other
colours. Aladdin gathered pockets full of them
and said, “I will gather these glass fruits and
play with them at home.”</p><p>
When he came to the steps, he was unable
to climb them by himself, without help. And he
called to the magician, “O my uncle, give me
your hand and help me to get up.” The wizard
replied, “Give me the Lamp, it is very heavy.”
But Aladdin answered, “No, the Lamp is not
heavy at all. Give me only your hand, and when
I am up, I will give you the Lamp.”</p><p>
But the wizard wanted only the Lamp and
became very angry. The wizard cried, “You silly
boy! You will stay here for ever!” He said
magical words and threw the stick into the fire.
Immediately the earth closed again. Aladdin remained
under the ground.</p><p>
The magician was just a 	
	stranger and no uncle of Aladdin. He read in
his magic books about a wonderful Lamp. This
Lamp could make him the most powerful man
in the world. He heaped the earth over Aladdin.</p><p>
Then he went away.</p><p>
But as for Aladdin, he began to call his
uncle. He shouted, and no one answered him.
Then he understood that the stranger was no
uncle at all. So Aladdin began to weep.</p><p>
Then he began to look for an exit. The
doors were shut. But he noticed the ring! The
false uncle gave him a ring and said, “This ring
will guard you from all danger.”</p><p>
So Aladdin rubbed the ring. Immediately a
Jinn appeared before him and cried, “Here I
am, your slave, between your hands. Ask what
you want, for I see the ring of my master.”</p><p>
When Aladdin saw the Jinn, he was very
afraid. But the Jinn said, “Ask what you want, I
am your servant, for the ring is on your hand.”</p>

<h3>Chapter 2.</h3>

<div>
<p>
Aladdin said, “Deliver me from this place!”
And the earth opened, and he found himself
outside.</p><p>
Aladdin came back home. He told his mother
what happened and showed her the Lamp and
the fruits.</p><p>
Aladdin said to his mother, “Ah, my mother,
that false uncle wanted to kill me! He is a
sorcerer, a liar.”</p><p>
In the morning his mother said to him, “We
don’t have anything to eat.”</p><p>
Aladdin replied, “Mother, give me the Lamp.
I think we can sell it.”</p><p>
She brought the Lamp. But it was very dirty,
so she said, “We need to clean and polish it.”
She took a handful of sand and began to
rub the lamp. Instantly a great Jinn appeared.
“I am the Slave of the Lamp. What do you
want?” The mother was very afraid and could
not say a word.</p><p>
Aladdin said, “O Slave of the Lamp, I am
hungry. Bring me something to eat!” The Jinn
brought him a magnificent tray, made of pure
silver. On the tray there were twelve golden 
dishes of various delicious foods and two silver
cups of clear water.</p><p>
So they began to eat. After that Aladdin said,
“The false uncle didn’t want gold or silver. He
ordered me to bring him the Lamp. He knew
its great value. But he tried to kill me, and he
went away, so now this Lamp is mine. It will
make us rich.”</p><p>
When they ate all the food, Aladdin sold one
of the golden plates. Then the Jinn gave him
another set of plates. Thus they lived happily
for many years.</p><p>
And he learned that the “fruits” which he
gathered in the Treasury were not of glass or
crystal. These things were precious stones. And
he knew that he was very rich.</p><p>
One day Aladdin heard an order from the
Sultan, “Let all the people close their stores
and shops and stay home! The daughter of the
Sultan will go to and from the bath.”
When Aladdin heard this order, he said, “All
the people talk of her beauty.</p><p>
I want to see her face!” </p><p>
	But this was very difficult because she
always went veiled.</p><p>
So Aladdin began to think about how to see
the face of the daughter of the Sultan. It seemed
best to him to stand behind the door of the
bath so as to see her face when she came in.
He went to the bath before her and stood behind
the door. When the daughter of the Sultan
appeared, she lifted her veil, and Aladdin saw
her face. It was like a sun or a pearl of great
price. He fell in love with her at first sight.
He returned to his mother. His mother spoke
to him, but he did not reply and did not eat.
So she asked, “O my son, what happened to
you? Are you sick?”</p><p>
Then Aladdin turned to his mother and said
to her, “O my mother, I am well and not sick
at all. But I saw the daughter of the Sultan. I
fell in love with her. I want to marry her!”
When his mother heard his words, she feared,
“O my son! You are mad. She is the Sultan’s
daughter.”</p><p>
Aladdin answered, “No, I’m not mad. I will
win the lovely princess! I cannot live without
her. I will marry her.”</p><p>
His mother said to him, “But who will tell
Sultan about it? You can not tell him yourself.
You must find a right person.”
Aladdin answered, “I have you! Please ask
the Sultan about his daughter.”</p><p>
His mother said, “Cast away this thought
and think whose son you are. You are the child
of a poor tailor. And I am very poor, too. So
how can you ask about marriage to a daughter
of the Sultan?”</p><p>
But at last she agreed to go.
His mother took a napkin and laid in it the
magic fruits from the magical garden. They shone
like the most beautiful jewels. She entered the
palace hall. But the Sultan did not notice her.
She went every day and stood in the same
place. On the sixth day the Sultan said to his vizir,
“Every day I see a woman. She carries something
in a napkin. Who is she? Call her next
time, I will see what she wants.”</p><p>
Next day the Sultan said to her, “Good
woman, tell me what you want.”</p><p>
She told him about her son’s love for the
princess.</p><p>
The Sultan asked her kindly what she had
in the napkin. She unfolded the jewels and
presented them to him.</p><p>
The Sultan was very amazed. The vizir wanted
the princess for his own son. So he begged the
Sultan to withhold the woman for three months.
During that time his son could make a richer
present.</p><p>
The Sultan told Aladdin’s mother, “I will
think about it. But you must not appear before
me again for three months. After that your son
can marry my daughter.”</p><p>
Aladdin waited patiently for nearly two
months. But one day he heard the news: the
son of the grand-vizir was going to marry the
Sultan’s daughter.</p><p>
Aladdin rubbed the Lamp. The Jinn appeared
and asked, “What is your will?”</p><p>
Aladdin replied, “The Sultan broke his promise to me. The vizir’s son is going to marry
the princess. My command is: tonight you must
bring here the bride and bridegroom.”</p><p>
“Master, I obey,” said the Jinn.</p><p>
Aladdin went to his room, where the Jinn
transported the bed with the vizir’s son and
the princess.</p><p>
“Take this newly-married man,” said Aladdin,
“put him outside in the cold and return
in the morning.”</p><p>
“Fear nothing,” Aladdin said to the princess.
“You are my wife. Your father promised you to
me. No harm will come to you.”</p><p>
The princess was very afraid. She passed
the most miserable night of her life. Aladdin
lay down beside her and slept very well. 
In the morning the Jinn returned the bridegroom.
He laid him in his place and transported
the bed back to the palace.</p><p>
The Sultan came to say his daughter good-morning.
The unhappy vizir’s son jumped up and
hid himself. The princess could not say a word.
The Sultan asked, “What happened?”</p><p>
The princess told how during the night the
bed travelled to a strange house. The Sultan
did not believe her. He considered it an idle
dream.</p><p>
The following night exactly the same thing
happened. The vizir’s son was very afraid and
said, “Your Majesty, I don’t want to marry anymore.
Please let me go.”</p><p>
The Sultan was very surprised but cancelled
the wedding.</p><p>
When the three months were over, Aladdin
sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his
promise.</p><p>
The Sultan did not want to see Aladdin. So
he asked the vizir’s advice. The vizir said to
him, “Just demand more jewels!”</p><p>
The Sultan then turned to Aladdin’s mother
and said, “Good woman, I remember my promises.
But your son must first send me forty basins
of jewels carried by forty slaves. Tell him that
I wait for his answer.”</p><p>
The mother of Aladdin went home. She
thought that all was lost.</p><p>
“Please calm,” her son said, “I will do that
for the princess — and even more!”</p><p>
He called the Jinn. In a few moments the
eighty slaves arrived. Each was carrying two
basins of wonderful jewels.</p><p>
Aladdin sent them to the palace. The slaves
entered the palace and stood before the Sultan.
The Sultan was very glad and said, “Good
woman, tell your son that I wait for him with
open arms.”</p><p>
She came back home joyfully. But Aladdin
first called the Jinn. </p><p>
“I want a beautiful dress,” he said, “a white
horse, and twenty slaves. And ten thousand pieces
of gold in ten purses.” The Jinn answered, “No
problem, my Master.”</p><p>
Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through
the streets. The slaves were strewing gold.
When the Sultan saw Aladdin, he came
down from his throne and led him into a hall.
He wanted to marry him to the princess that
very day.</p><p>
But Aladdin refused, and said, “I must build
a palace for her.”</p><p>
At home he said to the Jinn, “Build me a
palace of the finest marble, with jasper, agate,
and other precious stones.”</p><p>
The Jinn finished the palace by next day.
The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and
cymbals to meet them. The air resounded with
music and cheers.</p><p>
At night the princess said good-bye to her
father. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin.
The next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to
see the palace.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3.</h3>

<div>
<p>
Aladdin became the captain of the Sultan’s
armies. He won several battles for him but remained
modest and courteous. They lived in
peace and content for several years.
But far away in Africa the magician remembered
Aladdin. He discovered that Aladdin
escaped from the cave, married a princess and
was living in great honour and wealth!
He decided to steal the Lamp. He travelled
night and day till he reached the capital. When
he was passing through the town, the people
everywhere were talking about a marvellous
palace.</p><p>
“Forgive my ignorance,” he asked, “what is
this palace you speak of?”</p><p>
“Did you not hear about Prince Aladdin’s
palace,” was the reply, “the greatest wonder of
the world?”</p><p>
The magician saw the palace and became
half mad with rage. </p><p>
He bought a dozen copper lamps and put
them into a basket. Then he went to the palace,
crying, “New lamps for old!”</p><p>
Aladdin was not at the palace at the moment.
The princess sent a slave to find out what the
noise was about.</p><p>
“Your Majesty,” replied the slave, “an old fool
offers to exchange fine new lamps for old ones.”
Another slave said, “We have a very old
lamp, let’s change it.”</p><p>
But this was the magic Lamp, which Aladdin
left there. The princess did not know its value.
She went and said to the magician, “Give me
a new lamp for this.”</p><p>
The wizard immediately exchanged the lamps.
After that the wizard went away and rubbed the
Lamp. The Jinn appeared. The magician ordered
the Jinn to carry him, together with the palace
and the princess, to a lonely place in Africa.
The next morning the Sultan did not see the
Aladdin’s palace: it disappeared! He sent thirty
men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains.
“Where is my palace and my daughter?”
asked the Sultan.</p><p>
Aladdin could not say a word.</p><p>
“I must have my daughter back! And you
must find her or lose your head.”</p><p>
Aladdin begged for forty days to find her.
For three days he asked everyone what became
of his palace. Nobody knew the answer.</p><p>
He came to the banks of a river and rubbed
the magic ring he still wore. Another Jinn appeared.
“Save my life, Jinn,” said Aladdin, “and bring
my palace back.”</p><p>
“That is not in my power,” said the Jinn. “I
am only the Slave of the Ring. You must ask
the Slave of the Lamp.” “But you,” said Aladdin, 
“can take me to</p><p>
the palace and set me down under my wife’s
window.”</p><p>
He at once found himself in Africa, under
the window of the princess. That morning the
princess rose earlier than usual. As she was
dressing, one of her women saw Aladdin. The
princess ran and opened the window. They were
very happy to see each other again.</p><p>
“Please forgive me,” said the princess. “I
didn’t know anything about the Lamp. So I gave
it to the wizard. He is very evil, and he wants
to marry me.”</p><p>
Aladdin asked, “Where is the Lamp?”</p><p>
“The wizard carries it with him,” answered
the princess.</p><p>
Aladdin left her for a while. He changed
clothes, bought some poison, and returned to
the princess.</p><p>
“I will tell you what to do,” said Aladdin.
“Add this poison to the wizard’s drink. But don’t
let him notice that!” And Aladdin went away.
The princess listened carefully to Aladdin.
When the magician came, the princess said, “I 
realized that Aladdin is dead. All my tears will
not bring him back to me. So I am ready to
marry you.”</p><p>
The magician ran away to put on his wedding
dress. The princess put the poison in his cup.
When the wizard returned, he emptied his
cup and fell back lifeless.
The princess then opened the door to Aladdin.
He went to the dead magician and took
the Lamp. Then he bade the Jinn carry the
palace back.</p><p>
Very soon they were at home again.</p><p>
But this was not the end of the story.</p><p>
The African magician had a younger brother,
who was even more wicked and more cunning.
He travelled to the palace to avenge his brother’s
death. On his way he killed a holy woman
that cured people by her touch. He took her
clothes and put on her veil. </p><p>
Then he went towards the palace of Aladdin.
All the people thought he was a holy woman
and wanted to touch his hand.</p><p>
The princess heard the noise and asked what
the matter was. The slave said it was the holy
woman. The princess sent for her.</p><p>
“Please stay with us for ever,” said the princess.
The princess showed the false holy woman
the palace and asked “her” what “she” thought
of it.</p><p>
“It is truly beautiful,” said the wizard. “But
you need one thing.”</p><p>
“And what is that?” asked the princess.
“A roc’s egg,” replied he, “it is the nicest
wonder of the world.”</p><p>
After this the princess could think of nothing
but a roc’s egg. When Aladdin returned from
hunting, the princess looked very unhappy. She
told him about a roc’s egg.</p><p>
Aladdin rubbed the Lamp and commanded
the Jinn to bring a roc’s egg.</p><p>
“Is it not enough that I did everything for
you?” cried the Jinn. “You command me to
bring a roc’s egg! It’s impossible! This request
does not come from you, but from the brother
of the African magician. He is now in your
palace disguised as the holy woman — whom
he killed. Take care of yourself, for he wants
to kill you.”</p><p>
The Jinn disappeared.</p><p>
Aladdin went back to the princess. He looked
as if he had a terrible headache. He requested
that the holy woman lay her hands on his head.
But when the magician came near, Aladdin
took his dagger and pierced him to the heart.
“What did you do?” cried the princess. “You
killed the holy woman!”</p><p>
“Not so,” replied Aladdin, “but a wicked
magician!”</p><p>
After that Aladdin and his wife lived in peace.
When the Sultan died, Aladdin ruled for
many years. He did justice among the people,
and all the people loved him.
